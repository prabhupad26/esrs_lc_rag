Z\u00fcrich AG, which produces most of the airport's \nheat, can be operated with both gas and heating oil. In the year under review, much less \ngas and more oil was used, which had a negative impact on CO  emissions, as oil has a \nmuch larger emission factor than gas. Nevertheless, the CO  emissions of the central \nheating plant were reduced overall. This was because, on the one hand, heating \nrequirements were lower than average owing to the mild autumn and lack of a cold spell \nand, on the other, because the purchase of biogas made it possible to save 1365 tonnes\nof CO . The greenhouse gas emissions of vehicles and machinery also declined slightly. \nTotal greenhouse gas emissions in Scope 1 at Zurich Airport amounted to 29,043 tonnes\nin the reporting period, i.e. 10% lower than in the previous year. Emissions in Scope 2, of \nlesser importance compared with Scope 1, rose owing to the recovery in passenger \nvolumes of 25% to 24 tonnes. Therefore, emissions in Scope 1 and 2 remained below \nthe key threshold of 30,000 tonnes per year, the interim target for 2020. Owing to the \nsubstantial rise in traffic, the greenhouse gas emissions in Scope 3, determined primarily \nby emissions of aircraft en route to their destinations, reflected a sharp increase (+95%).\n2\n2\n2", "blob_id": 3, "document_ref": "65", "page_number": "65"}, 0.0666256994009018], [{"class_id": 5, "class_name": "table", "confidence": 0.9999970197677612, "box": [0.08464889228343964,

Z\u00fcrich AG, which produces most of the airport's \nheat, can be operated with both gas and heating oil. In the year under review, much less \ngas and more oil was used, which had a negative impact on CO  emissions, as oil has a \nmuch larger emission factor than gas. Nevertheless, the CO  emissions of the central \nheating plant were reduced overall. This was because, on the one hand, heating \nrequirements were lower than average owing to the mild autumn and lack of a cold spell \nand, on the other, because the purchase of biogas made it possible to save 1365 tonnes\nof CO . The greenhouse gas emissions of vehicles and machinery also declined slightly. \nTotal greenhouse gas emissions in Scope 1 at Zurich Airport amounted to 29,043 tonnes\nin the reporting period, i.e. 10% lower than in the previous year. Emissions in Scope 2, of \nlesser importance compared with Scope 1, rose owing to the recovery in passenger \nvolumes of 25% to 24 tonnes. Therefore, emissions in Scope 1 and 2 remained below \nthe key threshold of 30,000 tonnes per year, the interim target for 2020. Owing to the \nsubstantial rise in traffic, the greenhouse gas emissions in Scope 3, determined primarily \nby emissions of aircraft en route to their destinations, reflected a sharp increase

Therefore, emissions in Scope 1 and 2 remained below \nthe key threshold of 30,000 tonnes per year, the interim target for 2020.

"The central heating plant at Flughafen Z\u00fcrich AG, which produces most of the airport's \nheat, can be operated with both gas and heating oil. In the year under review, much less \ngas and more oil was used, which had a negative impact on CO  emissions, as oil has a \nmuch larger emission factor than gas. Nevertheless, the CO  emissions of the central \nheating plant were reduced overall. This was because, on the one hand, heating \nrequirements were lower than average owing to the mild autumn and lack of a cold spell \nand, on the other, because the purchase of biogas made it possible to save 1365 tonnes\nof CO . The greenhouse gas emissions of vehicles and machinery also declined slightly. \nTotal greenhouse gas emissions in Scope 1 at Zurich Airport amounted to 29,043 tonnes\nin the reporting period, i.e. 10% lower than in the previous year. Emissions in Scope 2, of \nlesser importance compared with Scope 1, rose owing to the recovery in passenger \nvolumes of 25% to 24 tonnes. Therefore, emissions in Scope 1 and 2 remained below \nthe key threshold of 30,000 tonnes per year, the interim target for 2020. Owing to the \nsubstantial rise in traffic, the greenhouse gas emissions in Scope 3, determined primarily \nby emissions of aircraft en route to their destinations, reflected a sharp increase
