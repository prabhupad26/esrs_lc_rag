This represents a 43% reduction compared to \nthe previous year (approximately 48,000 tons) and a 51% reduction \ncompared to the 2019 base-year level. The emissions result mainly \nfrom site operations and the purchase of energy. The climate \nstrategy includes the target of reducing the environmental \nfootprint of our locations worldwide by 70% by 2030 (compared to \nthe 2019 base-year level). \nIn 2022, we already implemented various measures to reduce \nour Scope 1 and 2 emissions. For example, we commissioned \nphotovoltaic systems at our sites in Bietigheim-Bissingen, \nSchopfloch, Holzbronn, Shanghai, and Barcelona. In this way, we \ngenerated a total of 2,669 MWh of electricity in 2022 using our own \nphotovoltaic systems, of which we used approximately 70% for our \nown consumption. Furthermore, we have converted the locations \nin Germany, India, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and the United States \nto green electricity. We aim to convert our remaining locations in \n2023. Since the beginning of 2022, we have been using natural gas \nas a bridging technology for supplying heat in Germany, which is \nmade carbon-neutral by means of externally audited certificates \nfrom our energy supplier. However, our long-term goal is to \ngradually minimize gas consumption and switch to alternative \ntechnologies. Further emission reductions are to be achieved \nthrough the successive conversion of the entire company vehicle \nfleet in Germany to alternative drives by 2030 at the latest. \nTo support the achievement of our environmental and climate \ntargets, we organized a three-day ideas campaign at our German \nlocations in November 2022. More than 700 employees took part \nand submitted a total of 350 suggestions for greater sustainability. \nWe used the new \u201cSpark\u201d ideas management platform for this \ncampaign. We also strengthen the environmental and climate \nawareness of our employees through communication measures \non the intranet and through sustainability training, for example \nfor new employees or prospective managers. \nour energy providers (market-based). We will publish detailed \ninformation on the Scope 3 emissions in the Sustainability Report \n2022, which will be released in mid-2023.\n2.28 \u2014  KEY FIGURES FOR ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND \nENERGY INTENSITY\n2022\n2021\n20201\n20191\nEnergy consumption  \n(in MWh)\nHeating oil and gas\n64,633\n67,926\n66,148\n66,310\nElectricity from con-\nventional sources\n30,909\n49,974\n50,956\n57,976\nPurchased electric-\nity from renewable \nenergies\n25,982\n4,656\n3,235\n3,768\nSelf-used electricity \nfrom own generation2\n7,018\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\nDistrict heating\n8,334\n5,108\n3,986\n3,772\nTotal\n136,876\n127,665\n124,326\n131,825\nEnergy intensity \n (consumption in MWh \nper \u20ac1 million in sales)\nHeating oil and gas\n15.0\n19.2\n19.9\n16.9\nElectricity from con-\nventional sources\n7.2\n14.1\n15.3\n14.8\nPurchased electric-\nity from renewable \nenergies\n6.0\n1.3\n1.0\n1.0\nSelf-used electricity \nfrom own generation2\n1.6\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\nDistrict heating\n1.9\n1.4\n1.2\n1.0\nTotal\n31.7\n36.1\n37.4\n33.6\nEnergy consumption \nindexed  \n(in relation to sales;  \nbase year: 2019 = 100)\nHeating oil and gas\n89\n114\n118\n100\nElectricity from con-\nventional sources\n48\n96\n104\n100\nPurchased electric-\nity from renewable \nenergies\n627\n137\n101\n100\nSelf-used electricity \nfrom own generation3\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\nDistrict heating\n201\n150\n125\n100\nTotal\n94\n107\n111\n100\n UNAUDITED", "blob_id": 2, "document_ref": "67", "page_number": "67"}, 0.006282643415033817]], "ground_truth": "1 Market-based: Calculation based on specific information from our energy providers\n2 Adjustments due to recalculation on the basis of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol\n3  Scope 3 emissions shown here only take into account emissions from business flights, not \nemissions caused in the supply chain or by the use of our products in customers\u2019 plants.\nCompared to 2021, energy consumption has increased by around \n7%, which is significantly less than the increase in sales (22%). \nAccordingly, energy intensity has decreased significantly: Per \n\u20ac1 million in sales, we used 12.2% less energy than in 2021. \nConsumption of oil and gas (mainly natural gas) decreased by 5% \ncompared to the previous year.
