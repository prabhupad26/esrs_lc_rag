There are \nthree components to this metric:\n1. the GHG emissions, CO2e, in tonnes for each \nentity in which we are invested, arising from the \nunderlying scope 1 and 2 emissions \ndirectly connected with its operations\n2. a unit of value to normalise the emissions \nby the underlying size of the entity we are investing \nin, measured per \u00a3m. For our primary metric we use:\n\u2013 EVIC for corporate issuers\n\u2013 sovereign capital stock for sovereigns\n\u2013 market valuation for each real asset investment\n3. the size of our holding in the entity.\nThe investment portfolio emissions intensity is \nthen calculated by weighting the normalised emissions \n(tonnes of CO2e emissions per \u00a3m normaliser \nentity value as defined above) by the size of our \ninvestment and aggregating all holdings in our \ninvestment portfolio.\nWe have applied the emissions data equally to \nequities and bonds as they are both used by \ncorporates to raise capital and fund the business.\nOur calculation methodology for our primary \neconomic carbon intensity metric aligns with:\n\u2022 PCAF stock emission intensity methodologies1 \n(that is to say using EVIC as the stock emission \nintensity normaliser), where available\n\u2022 TCFD\u2019s carbon footprint portfolio weighting \nmethodology2 (that is to say stock intensities \nare weighted by portfolio value).\nWhile standards are still emerging, we also provide \nan alternative flow-based WACI metric, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by the revenues of the \nunderlying entity in the case of corporate issuers, and \nGDP in the case of sovereigns, as aligned to TCFD\u2019s \nequivalent methodology. We also have started to track \nphysical carbon intensity metrics, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by a measure of physical \noutput, for certain asset class and sector subsets \nof the portfolio, in line with SBTi requirements3. \nFurther detail on the methodology, including the \nsourcing and application of the underlying data \nused in these metrics can be found in the additional \ninformation chapter on page 49. There are large \nsegments of our portfolio where we have to rely \non estimated rather than actual emissions data, \nor where there is no data at all. We are also reliant \non third party data.\nScope 3 investment portfolio economic carbon \nintensity: 2022 results\nTable 5 shows the December 2022 group investment \nportfolio GHG emission intensity score of 73 tCO2e/\u00a3m \ninvested (-5% in 2022; and -23% from the 2019 base year).\n \nWhen applied to the \u00a379.4 billion4 of assets in this \nanalysis, this gives an absolute footprint of 5.8 million \ntCO2e emissions (2021: 7.3 million tCO2e).\nWithin the annual movement in 2022, 2% is attributed \nto the change in updated portfolio emissions (from \nupdated company carbon disclosures, and from \ntrading activity) by holding EVIC constant, as shown \nin the table below. Our reported emissions in 2021 \nwere impacted by the pandemic and the resultant \nimpact on corporate and economic activity. This year \nwe have witnessed a partial reversal of this movement \ndue to lags in reporting of the underlying emissions \ndata, as expected. \nA reversal of this movement is then attributed \nto changes in the EVIC of the investments in 2022, \nillustrating the impact that market movements can \nhave on economic emission intensity metrics.\nTable 5.

There are \nthree components to this metric:\n1. the GHG emissions, CO2e, in tonnes for each \nentity in which we are invested, arising from the \nunderlying scope 1 and 2 emissions \ndirectly connected with its operations\n2. a unit of value to normalise the emissions \nby the underlying size of the entity we are investing \nin, measured per \u00a3m. For our primary metric we use:\n\u2013 EVIC for corporate issuers\n\u2013 sovereign capital stock for sovereigns\n\u2013 market valuation for each real asset investment\n3. the size of our holding in the entity.\nThe investment portfolio emissions intensity is \nthen calculated by weighting the normalised emissions \n(tonnes of CO2e emissions per \u00a3m normaliser \nentity value as defined above) by the size of our \ninvestment and aggregating all holdings in our \ninvestment portfolio.\nWe have applied the emissions data equally to \nequities and bonds as they are both used by \ncorporates to raise capital and fund the business.\nOur calculation methodology for our primary \neconomic carbon intensity metric aligns with:\n\u2022 PCAF stock emission intensity methodologies1 \n(that is to say using EVIC as the stock emission \nintensity normaliser), where available\n\u2022 TCFD\u2019s carbon footprint portfolio weighting \nmethodology2 (that is to say stock intensities \nare weighted by portfolio value).\nWhile standards are still emerging, we also provide \nan alternative flow-based WACI metric, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by the revenues of the \nunderlying entity in the case of corporate issuers, and \nGDP in the case of sovereigns, as aligned to TCFD\u2019s \nequivalent methodology. We also have started to track \nphysical carbon intensity metrics, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by a measure of physical \noutput, for certain asset class and sector subsets \nof the portfolio, in line with SBTi requirements3. \nFurther detail on the methodology, including the \nsourcing and application of the underlying data \nused in these metrics can be found in the additional \ninformation chapter on page 49. There are large \nsegments of our portfolio where we have to rely \non estimated rather than actual emissions data, \nor where there is no data at all. We are also reliant \non third party data.\nScope 3 investment portfolio economic carbon \nintensity: 2022 results\nTable 5 shows the December 2022 group investment \nportfolio GHG emission intensity score of 73 tCO2e/\u00a3m \ninvested (-5% in 2022; and -23% from the 2019 base year).\n \nWhen applied to the \u00a379.4 billion4 of assets in this \nanalysis, this gives an absolute footprint of 5.8 million \ntCO2e emissions (2021: 7.3 million tCO2e).\nWithin the annual movement in 2022, 2% is attributed \nto the change in updated portfolio emissions (from \nupdated company carbon disclosures, and from \ntrading activity) by holding EVIC constant, as shown \nin the table below. Our reported emissions in 2021 \nwere impacted by the pandemic and the resultant \nimpact on corporate and economic activity. This year \nwe have witnessed a partial reversal of this movement \ndue to lags in reporting of the underlying emissions \ndata, as expected. \nA reversal of this movement is then attributed \nto changes in the EVIC of the investments in 2022, \nillustrating the impact that market movements can \nhave on economic emission intensity metrics.\nTable 5.

There are \nthree components to this metric:\n1. the GHG emissions, CO2e, in tonnes for each \nentity in which we are invested, arising from the \nunderlying scope 1 and 2 emissions \ndirectly connected with its operations\n2. a unit of value to normalise the emissions \nby the underlying size of the entity we are investing \nin, measured per \u00a3m. For our primary metric we use:\n\u2013 EVIC for corporate issuers\n\u2013 sovereign capital stock for sovereigns\n\u2013 market valuation for each real asset investment\n3. the size of our holding in the entity.\nThe investment portfolio emissions intensity is \nthen calculated by weighting the normalised emissions \n(tonnes of CO2e emissions per \u00a3m normaliser \nentity value as defined above) by the size of our \ninvestment and aggregating all holdings in our \ninvestment portfolio.\nWe have applied the emissions data equally to \nequities and bonds as they are both used by \ncorporates to raise capital and fund the business.\nOur calculation methodology for our primary \neconomic carbon intensity metric aligns with:\n\u2022 PCAF stock emission intensity methodologies1 \n(that is to say using EVIC as the stock emission \nintensity normaliser), where available\n\u2022 TCFD\u2019s carbon footprint portfolio weighting \nmethodology2 (that is to say stock intensities \nare weighted by portfolio value).\nWhile standards are still emerging, we also provide \nan alternative flow-based WACI metric, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by the revenues of the \nunderlying entity in the case of corporate issuers, and \nGDP in the case of sovereigns, as aligned to TCFD\u2019s \nequivalent methodology. We also have started to track \nphysical carbon intensity metrics, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by a measure of physical \noutput, for certain asset class and sector subsets \nof the portfolio, in line with SBTi requirements3. \nFurther detail on the methodology, including the \nsourcing and application of the underlying data \nused in these metrics can be found in the additional \ninformation chapter on page 49. There are large \nsegments of our portfolio where we have to rely \non estimated rather than actual emissions data, \nor where there is no data at all. We are also reliant \non third party data.\nScope 3 investment portfolio economic carbon \nintensity: 2022 results\nTable 5 shows the December 2022 group investment \nportfolio GHG emission intensity score of 73 tCO2e/\u00a3m \ninvested (-5% in 2022; and -23% from the 2019 base year).\n \nWhen applied to the \u00a379.4 billion4 of assets in this \nanalysis, this gives an absolute footprint of 5.8 million \ntCO2e emissions (2021: 7.3 million tCO2e).\nWithin the annual movement in 2022, 2% is attributed \nto the change in updated portfolio emissions (from \nupdated company carbon disclosures, and from \ntrading activity) by holding EVIC constant, as shown \nin the table below. Our reported emissions in 2021 \nwere impacted by the pandemic and the resultant \nimpact on corporate and economic activity. This year \nwe have witnessed a partial reversal of this movement \ndue to lags in reporting of the underlying emissions \ndata, as expected. \nA reversal of this movement is then attributed \nto changes in the EVIC of the investments in 2022, \nillustrating the impact that market movements can \nhave on economic emission intensity metrics.\nTable 5.

For some key asset classes, \nasset class-specific approaches are employed, while \nfor others that are not covered in our datasets, we use \nsector-based proxies.

There are \nthree components to this metric:\n1. the GHG emissions, CO2e, in tonnes for each \nentity in which we are invested, arising from the \nunderlying scope 1 and 2 emissions \ndirectly connected with its operations\n2. a unit of value to normalise the emissions \nby the underlying size of the entity we are investing \nin, measured per \u00a3m. For our primary metric we use:\n\u2013 EVIC for corporate issuers\n\u2013 sovereign capital stock for sovereigns\n\u2013 market valuation for each real asset investment\n3. the size of our holding in the entity.\nThe investment portfolio emissions intensity is \nthen calculated by weighting the normalised emissions \n(tonnes of CO2e emissions per \u00a3m normaliser \nentity value as defined above) by the size of our \ninvestment and aggregating all holdings in our \ninvestment portfolio.\nWe have applied the emissions data equally to \nequities and bonds as they are both used by \ncorporates to raise capital and fund the business.\nOur calculation methodology for our primary \neconomic carbon intensity metric aligns with:\n\u2022 PCAF stock emission intensity methodologies1 \n(that is to say using EVIC as the stock emission \nintensity normaliser), where available\n\u2022 TCFD\u2019s carbon footprint portfolio weighting \nmethodology2 (that is to say stock intensities \nare weighted by portfolio value).\nWhile standards are still emerging, we also provide \nan alternative flow-based WACI metric, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by the revenues of the \nunderlying entity in the case of corporate issuers, and \nGDP in the case of sovereigns, as aligned to TCFD\u2019s \nequivalent methodology. We also have started to track \nphysical carbon intensity metrics, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by a measure of physical \noutput, for certain asset class and sector subsets \nof the portfolio, in line with SBTi requirements3. \nFurther detail on the methodology, including the \nsourcing and application of the underlying data \nused in these metrics can be found in the additional \ninformation chapter on page 49. There are large \nsegments of our portfolio where we have to rely \non estimated rather than actual emissions data, \nor where there is no data at all. We are also reliant \non third party data.\nScope 3 investment portfolio economic carbon \nintensity: 2022 results\nTable 5 shows the December 2022 group investment \nportfolio GHG emission intensity score of 73 tCO2e/\u00a3m \ninvested (-5% in 2022; and -23% from the 2019 base year).\n \nWhen applied to the \u00a379.4 billion4 of assets in this \nanalysis, this gives an absolute footprint of 5.8 million \ntCO2e emissions (2021: 7.3 million tCO2e).\nWithin the annual movement in 2022, 2% is attributed \nto the change in updated portfolio emissions (from \nupdated company carbon disclosures, and from \ntrading activity) by holding EVIC constant, as shown \nin the table below. Our reported emissions in 2021 \nwere impacted by the pandemic and the resultant \nimpact on corporate and economic activity. This year \nwe have witnessed a partial reversal of this movement \ndue to lags in reporting of the underlying emissions \ndata, as expected. \nA reversal of this movement is then attributed \nto changes in the EVIC of the investments in 2022, \nillustrating the impact that market movements can \nhave on economic emission intensity metrics.\nTable 5.

There are \nthree components to this metric:\n1. the GHG emissions, CO2e, in tonnes for each \nentity in which we are invested, arising from the \nunderlying scope 1 and 2 emissions \ndirectly connected with its operations\n2. a unit of value to normalise the emissions \nby the underlying size of the entity we are investing \nin, measured per \u00a3m. For our primary metric we use:\n\u2013 EVIC for corporate issuers\n\u2013 sovereign capital stock for sovereigns\n\u2013 market valuation for each real asset investment\n3. the size of our holding in the entity.\nThe investment portfolio emissions intensity is \nthen calculated by weighting the normalised emissions \n(tonnes of CO2e emissions per \u00a3m normaliser \nentity value as defined above) by the size of our \ninvestment and aggregating all holdings in our \ninvestment portfolio.\nWe have applied the emissions data equally to \nequities and bonds as they are both used by \ncorporates to raise capital and fund the business.\nOur calculation methodology for our primary \neconomic carbon intensity metric aligns with:\n\u2022 PCAF stock emission intensity methodologies1 \n(that is to say using EVIC as the stock emission \nintensity normaliser), where available\n\u2022 TCFD\u2019s carbon footprint portfolio weighting \nmethodology2 (that is to say stock intensities \nare weighted by portfolio value).\nWhile standards are still emerging, we also provide \nan alternative flow-based WACI metric, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by the revenues of the \nunderlying entity in the case of corporate issuers, and \nGDP in the case of sovereigns, as aligned to TCFD\u2019s \nequivalent methodology. We also have started to track \nphysical carbon intensity metrics, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by a measure of physical \noutput, for certain asset class and sector subsets \nof the portfolio, in line with SBTi requirements3. \nFurther detail on the methodology, including the \nsourcing and application of the underlying data \nused in these metrics can be found in the additional \ninformation chapter on page 49. There are large \nsegments of our portfolio where we have to rely \non estimated rather than actual emissions data, \nor where there is no data at all. We are also reliant \non third party data.\nScope 3 investment portfolio economic carbon \nintensity: 2022 results\nTable 5 shows the December 2022 group investment \nportfolio GHG emission intensity score of 73 tCO2e/\u00a3m \ninvested (-5% in 2022; and -23% from the 2019 base year).\n \nWhen applied to the \u00a379.4 billion4 of assets in this \nanalysis, this gives an absolute footprint of 5.8 million \ntCO2e emissions (2021: 7.3 million tCO2e).\nWithin the annual movement in 2022, 2% is attributed \nto the change in updated portfolio emissions (from \nupdated company carbon disclosures, and from \ntrading activity) by holding EVIC constant, as shown \nin the table below. Our reported emissions in 2021 \nwere impacted by the pandemic and the resultant \nimpact on corporate and economic activity. This year \nwe have witnessed a partial reversal of this movement \ndue to lags in reporting of the underlying emissions \ndata, as expected. \nA reversal of this movement is then attributed \nto changes in the EVIC of the investments in 2022, \nillustrating the impact that market movements can \nhave on economic emission intensity metrics.\nTable 5.

There are \nthree components to this metric:\n1. the GHG emissions, CO2e, in tonnes for each \nentity in which we are invested, arising from the \nunderlying scope 1 and 2 emissions \ndirectly connected with its operations\n2. a unit of value to normalise the emissions \nby the underlying size of the entity we are investing \nin, measured per \u00a3m. For our primary metric we use:\n\u2013 EVIC for corporate issuers\n\u2013 sovereign capital stock for sovereigns\n\u2013 market valuation for each real asset investment\n3. the size of our holding in the entity.\nThe investment portfolio emissions intensity is \nthen calculated by weighting the normalised emissions \n(tonnes of CO2e emissions per \u00a3m normaliser \nentity value as defined above) by the size of our \ninvestment and aggregating all holdings in our \ninvestment portfolio.\nWe have applied the emissions data equally to \nequities and bonds as they are both used by \ncorporates to raise capital and fund the business.\nOur calculation methodology for our primary \neconomic carbon intensity metric aligns with:\n\u2022 PCAF stock emission intensity methodologies1 \n(that is to say using EVIC as the stock emission \nintensity normaliser), where available\n\u2022 TCFD\u2019s carbon footprint portfolio weighting \nmethodology2 (that is to say stock intensities \nare weighted by portfolio value).\nWhile standards are still emerging, we also provide \nan alternative flow-based WACI metric, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by the revenues of the \nunderlying entity in the case of corporate issuers, and \nGDP in the case of sovereigns, as aligned to TCFD\u2019s \nequivalent methodology. We also have started to track \nphysical carbon intensity metrics, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by a measure of physical \noutput, for certain asset class and sector subsets \nof the portfolio, in line with SBTi requirements3. \nFurther detail on the methodology, including the \nsourcing and application of the underlying data \nused in these metrics can be found in the additional \ninformation chapter on page 49. There are large \nsegments of our portfolio where we have to rely \non estimated rather than actual emissions data, \nor where there is no data at all. We are also reliant \non third party data.\nScope 3 investment portfolio economic carbon \nintensity: 2022 results\nTable 5 shows the December 2022 group investment \nportfolio GHG emission intensity score of 73 tCO2e/\u00a3m \ninvested (-5% in 2022; and -23% from the 2019 base year).\n \nWhen applied to the \u00a379.4 billion4 of assets in this \nanalysis, this gives an absolute footprint of 5.8 million \ntCO2e emissions (2021: 7.3 million tCO2e).\nWithin the annual movement in 2022, 2% is attributed \nto the change in updated portfolio emissions (from \nupdated company carbon disclosures, and from \ntrading activity) by holding EVIC constant, as shown \nin the table below. Our reported emissions in 2021 \nwere impacted by the pandemic and the resultant \nimpact on corporate and economic activity. This year \nwe have witnessed a partial reversal of this movement \ndue to lags in reporting of the underlying emissions \ndata, as expected. \nA reversal of this movement is then attributed \nto changes in the EVIC of the investments in 2022, \nillustrating the impact that market movements can \nhave on economic emission intensity metrics.\nTable 5.

There are \nthree components to this metric:\n1. the GHG emissions, CO2e, in tonnes for each \nentity in which we are invested, arising from the \nunderlying scope 1 and 2 emissions \ndirectly connected with its operations\n2. a unit of value to normalise the emissions \nby the underlying size of the entity we are investing \nin, measured per \u00a3m. For our primary metric we use:\n\u2013 EVIC for corporate issuers\n\u2013 sovereign capital stock for sovereigns\n\u2013 market valuation for each real asset investment\n3. the size of our holding in the entity.\nThe investment portfolio emissions intensity is \nthen calculated by weighting the normalised emissions \n(tonnes of CO2e emissions per \u00a3m normaliser \nentity value as defined above) by the size of our \ninvestment and aggregating all holdings in our \ninvestment portfolio.\nWe have applied the emissions data equally to \nequities and bonds as they are both used by \ncorporates to raise capital and fund the business.\nOur calculation methodology for our primary \neconomic carbon intensity metric aligns with:\n\u2022 PCAF stock emission intensity methodologies1 \n(that is to say using EVIC as the stock emission \nintensity normaliser), where available\n\u2022 TCFD\u2019s carbon footprint portfolio weighting \nmethodology2 (that is to say stock intensities \nare weighted by portfolio value).\nWhile standards are still emerging, we also provide \nan alternative flow-based WACI metric, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by the revenues of the \nunderlying entity in the case of corporate issuers, and \nGDP in the case of sovereigns, as aligned to TCFD\u2019s \nequivalent methodology. We also have started to track \nphysical carbon intensity metrics, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by a measure of physical \noutput, for certain asset class and sector subsets \nof the portfolio, in line with SBTi requirements3. \nFurther detail on the methodology, including the \nsourcing and application of the underlying data \nused in these metrics can be found in the additional \ninformation chapter on page 49. There are large \nsegments of our portfolio where we have to rely \non estimated rather than actual emissions data, \nor where there is no data at all. We are also reliant \non third party data.\nScope 3 investment portfolio economic carbon \nintensity: 2022 results\nTable 5 shows the December 2022 group investment \nportfolio GHG emission intensity score of 73 tCO2e/\u00a3m \ninvested (-5% in 2022; and -23% from the 2019 base year).\n \nWhen applied to the \u00a379.4 billion4 of assets in this \nanalysis, this gives an absolute footprint of 5.8 million \ntCO2e emissions (2021: 7.3 million tCO2e).\nWithin the annual movement in 2022, 2% is attributed \nto the change in updated portfolio emissions (from \nupdated company carbon disclosures, and from \ntrading activity) by holding EVIC constant, as shown \nin the table below. Our reported emissions in 2021 \nwere impacted by the pandemic and the resultant \nimpact on corporate and economic activity. This year \nwe have witnessed a partial reversal of this movement \ndue to lags in reporting of the underlying emissions \ndata, as expected. \nA reversal of this movement is then attributed \nto changes in the EVIC of the investments in 2022, \nillustrating the impact that market movements can \nhave on economic emission intensity metrics.\nTable 5.

There are \nthree components to this metric:\n1. the GHG emissions, CO2e, in tonnes for each \nentity in which we are invested, arising from the \nunderlying scope 1 and 2 emissions \ndirectly connected with its operations\n2. a unit of value to normalise the emissions \nby the underlying size of the entity we are investing \nin, measured per \u00a3m. For our primary metric we use:\n\u2013 EVIC for corporate issuers\n\u2013 sovereign capital stock for sovereigns\n\u2013 market valuation for each real asset investment\n3. the size of our holding in the entity.\nThe investment portfolio emissions intensity is \nthen calculated by weighting the normalised emissions \n(tonnes of CO2e emissions per \u00a3m normaliser \nentity value as defined above) by the size of our \ninvestment and aggregating all holdings in our \ninvestment portfolio.\nWe have applied the emissions data equally to \nequities and bonds as they are both used by \ncorporates to raise capital and fund the business.\nOur calculation methodology for our primary \neconomic carbon intensity metric aligns with:\n\u2022 PCAF stock emission intensity methodologies1 \n(that is to say using EVIC as the stock emission \nintensity normaliser), where available\n\u2022 TCFD\u2019s carbon footprint portfolio weighting \nmethodology2 (that is to say stock intensities \nare weighted by portfolio value).\nWhile standards are still emerging, we also provide \nan alternative flow-based WACI metric, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by the revenues of the \nunderlying entity in the case of corporate issuers, and \nGDP in the case of sovereigns, as aligned to TCFD\u2019s \nequivalent methodology. We also have started to track \nphysical carbon intensity metrics, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by a measure of physical \noutput, for certain asset class and sector subsets \nof the portfolio, in line with SBTi requirements3. \nFurther detail on the methodology, including the \nsourcing and application of the underlying data \nused in these metrics can be found in the additional \ninformation chapter on page 49. There are large \nsegments of our portfolio where we have to rely \non estimated rather than actual emissions data, \nor where there is no data at all. We are also reliant \non third party data.\nScope 3 investment portfolio economic carbon \nintensity: 2022 results\nTable 5 shows the December 2022 group investment \nportfolio GHG emission intensity score of 73 tCO2e/\u00a3m \ninvested (-5% in 2022; and -23% from the 2019 base year).\n \nWhen applied to the \u00a379.4 billion4 of assets in this \nanalysis, this gives an absolute footprint of 5.8 million \ntCO2e emissions (2021: 7.3 million tCO2e).\nWithin the annual movement in 2022, 2% is attributed \nto the change in updated portfolio emissions (from \nupdated company carbon disclosures, and from \ntrading activity) by holding EVIC constant, as shown \nin the table below. Our reported emissions in 2021 \nwere impacted by the pandemic and the resultant \nimpact on corporate and economic activity. This year \nwe have witnessed a partial reversal of this movement \ndue to lags in reporting of the underlying emissions \ndata, as expected. \nA reversal of this movement is then attributed \nto changes in the EVIC of the investments in 2022, \nillustrating the impact that market movements can \nhave on economic emission intensity metrics.\nTable 5.

There are \nthree components to this metric:\n1. the GHG emissions, CO2e, in tonnes for each \nentity in which we are invested, arising from the \nunderlying scope 1 and 2 emissions \ndirectly connected with its operations\n2. a unit of value to normalise the emissions \nby the underlying size of the entity we are investing \nin, measured per \u00a3m. For our primary metric we use:\n\u2013 EVIC for corporate issuers\n\u2013 sovereign capital stock for sovereigns\n\u2013 market valuation for each real asset investment\n3. the size of our holding in the entity.\nThe investment portfolio emissions intensity is \nthen calculated by weighting the normalised emissions \n(tonnes of CO2e emissions per \u00a3m normaliser \nentity value as defined above) by the size of our \ninvestment and aggregating all holdings in our \ninvestment portfolio.\nWe have applied the emissions data equally to \nequities and bonds as they are both used by \ncorporates to raise capital and fund the business.\nOur calculation methodology for our primary \neconomic carbon intensity metric aligns with:\n\u2022 PCAF stock emission intensity methodologies1 \n(that is to say using EVIC as the stock emission \nintensity normaliser), where available\n\u2022 TCFD\u2019s carbon footprint portfolio weighting \nmethodology2 (that is to say stock intensities \nare weighted by portfolio value).\nWhile standards are still emerging, we also provide \nan alternative flow-based WACI metric, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by the revenues of the \nunderlying entity in the case of corporate issuers, and \nGDP in the case of sovereigns, as aligned to TCFD\u2019s \nequivalent methodology. We also have started to track \nphysical carbon intensity metrics, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by a measure of physical \noutput, for certain asset class and sector subsets \nof the portfolio, in line with SBTi requirements3. \nFurther detail on the methodology, including the \nsourcing and application of the underlying data \nused in these metrics can be found in the additional \ninformation chapter on page 49. There are large \nsegments of our portfolio where we have to rely \non estimated rather than actual emissions data, \nor where there is no data at all. We are also reliant \non third party data.\nScope 3 investment portfolio economic carbon \nintensity: 2022 results\nTable 5 shows the December 2022 group investment \nportfolio GHG emission intensity score of 73 tCO2e/\u00a3m \ninvested (-5% in 2022; and -23% from the 2019 base year).\n \nWhen applied to the \u00a379.4 billion4 of assets in this \nanalysis, this gives an absolute footprint of 5.8 million \ntCO2e emissions (2021: 7.3 million tCO2e).\nWithin the annual movement in 2022, 2% is attributed \nto the change in updated portfolio emissions (from \nupdated company carbon disclosures, and from \ntrading activity) by holding EVIC constant, as shown \nin the table below. Our reported emissions in 2021 \nwere impacted by the pandemic and the resultant \nimpact on corporate and economic activity. This year \nwe have witnessed a partial reversal of this movement \ndue to lags in reporting of the underlying emissions \ndata, as expected. \nA reversal of this movement is then attributed \nto changes in the EVIC of the investments in 2022, \nillustrating the impact that market movements can \nhave on economic emission intensity metrics.\nTable 5.

There are \nthree components to this metric:\n1. the GHG emissions, CO2e, in tonnes for each \nentity in which we are invested, arising from the \nunderlying scope 1 and 2 emissions \ndirectly connected with its operations\n2. a unit of value to normalise the emissions \nby the underlying size of the entity we are investing \nin, measured per \u00a3m. For our primary metric we use:\n\u2013 EVIC for corporate issuers\n\u2013 sovereign capital stock for sovereigns\n\u2013 market valuation for each real asset investment\n3. the size of our holding in the entity.\nThe investment portfolio emissions intensity is \nthen calculated by weighting the normalised emissions \n(tonnes of CO2e emissions per \u00a3m normaliser \nentity value as defined above) by the size of our \ninvestment and aggregating all holdings in our \ninvestment portfolio.\nWe have applied the emissions data equally to \nequities and bonds as they are both used by \ncorporates to raise capital and fund the business.\nOur calculation methodology for our primary \neconomic carbon intensity metric aligns with:\n\u2022 PCAF stock emission intensity methodologies1 \n(that is to say using EVIC as the stock emission \nintensity normaliser), where available\n\u2022 TCFD\u2019s carbon footprint portfolio weighting \nmethodology2 (that is to say stock intensities \nare weighted by portfolio value).\nWhile standards are still emerging, we also provide \nan alternative flow-based WACI metric, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by the revenues of the \nunderlying entity in the case of corporate issuers, and \nGDP in the case of sovereigns, as aligned to TCFD\u2019s \nequivalent methodology. We also have started to track \nphysical carbon intensity metrics, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by a measure of physical \noutput, for certain asset class and sector subsets \nof the portfolio, in line with SBTi requirements3. \nFurther detail on the methodology, including the \nsourcing and application of the underlying data \nused in these metrics can be found in the additional \ninformation chapter on page 49. There are large \nsegments of our portfolio where we have to rely \non estimated rather than actual emissions data, \nor where there is no data at all. We are also reliant \non third party data.\nScope 3 investment portfolio economic carbon \nintensity: 2022 results\nTable 5 shows the December 2022 group investment \nportfolio GHG emission intensity score of 73 tCO2e/\u00a3m \ninvested (-5% in 2022; and -23% from the 2019 base year).\n \nWhen applied to the \u00a379.4 billion4 of assets in this \nanalysis, this gives an absolute footprint of 5.8 million \ntCO2e emissions (2021: 7.3 million tCO2e).\nWithin the annual movement in 2022, 2% is attributed \nto the change in updated portfolio emissions (from \nupdated company carbon disclosures, and from \ntrading activity) by holding EVIC constant, as shown \nin the table below. Our reported emissions in 2021 \nwere impacted by the pandemic and the resultant \nimpact on corporate and economic activity. This year \nwe have witnessed a partial reversal of this movement \ndue to lags in reporting of the underlying emissions \ndata, as expected. \nA reversal of this movement is then attributed \nto changes in the EVIC of the investments in 2022, \nillustrating the impact that market movements can \nhave on economic emission intensity metrics.\nTable 5.

There are \nthree components to this metric:\n1. the GHG emissions, CO2e, in tonnes for each \nentity in which we are invested, arising from the \nunderlying scope 1 and 2 emissions \ndirectly connected with its operations\n2. a unit of value to normalise the emissions \nby the underlying size of the entity we are investing \nin, measured per \u00a3m. For our primary metric we use:\n\u2013 EVIC for corporate issuers\n\u2013 sovereign capital stock for sovereigns\n\u2013 market valuation for each real asset investment\n3. the size of our holding in the entity.\nThe investment portfolio emissions intensity is \nthen calculated by weighting the normalised emissions \n(tonnes of CO2e emissions per \u00a3m normaliser \nentity value as defined above) by the size of our \ninvestment and aggregating all holdings in our \ninvestment portfolio.\nWe have applied the emissions data equally to \nequities and bonds as they are both used by \ncorporates to raise capital and fund the business.\nOur calculation methodology for our primary \neconomic carbon intensity metric aligns with:\n\u2022 PCAF stock emission intensity methodologies1 \n(that is to say using EVIC as the stock emission \nintensity normaliser), where available\n\u2022 TCFD\u2019s carbon footprint portfolio weighting \nmethodology2 (that is to say stock intensities \nare weighted by portfolio value).\nWhile standards are still emerging, we also provide \nan alternative flow-based WACI metric, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by the revenues of the \nunderlying entity in the case of corporate issuers, and \nGDP in the case of sovereigns, as aligned to TCFD\u2019s \nequivalent methodology. We also have started to track \nphysical carbon intensity metrics, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by a measure of physical \noutput, for certain asset class and sector subsets \nof the portfolio, in line with SBTi requirements3. \nFurther detail on the methodology, including the \nsourcing and application of the underlying data \nused in these metrics can be found in the additional \ninformation chapter on page 49. There are large \nsegments of our portfolio where we have to rely \non estimated rather than actual emissions data, \nor where there is no data at all. We are also reliant \non third party data.\nScope 3 investment portfolio economic carbon \nintensity: 2022 results\nTable 5 shows the December 2022 group investment \nportfolio GHG emission intensity score of 73 tCO2e/\u00a3m \ninvested (-5% in 2022; and -23% from the 2019 base year).\n \nWhen applied to the \u00a379.4 billion4 of assets in this \nanalysis, this gives an absolute footprint of 5.8 million \ntCO2e emissions (2021: 7.3 million tCO2e).\nWithin the annual movement in 2022, 2% is attributed \nto the change in updated portfolio emissions (from \nupdated company carbon disclosures, and from \ntrading activity) by holding EVIC constant, as shown \nin the table below. Our reported emissions in 2021 \nwere impacted by the pandemic and the resultant \nimpact on corporate and economic activity. This year \nwe have witnessed a partial reversal of this movement \ndue to lags in reporting of the underlying emissions \ndata, as expected. \nA reversal of this movement is then attributed \nto changes in the EVIC of the investments in 2022, \nillustrating the impact that market movements can \nhave on economic emission intensity metrics.\nTable 5.

There are \nthree components to this metric:\n1. the GHG emissions, CO2e, in tonnes for each \nentity in which we are invested, arising from the \nunderlying scope 1 and 2 emissions \ndirectly connected with its operations\n2. a unit of value to normalise the emissions \nby the underlying size of the entity we are investing \nin, measured per \u00a3m. For our primary metric we use:\n\u2013 EVIC for corporate issuers\n\u2013 sovereign capital stock for sovereigns\n\u2013 market valuation for each real asset investment\n3. the size of our holding in the entity.\nThe investment portfolio emissions intensity is \nthen calculated by weighting the normalised emissions \n(tonnes of CO2e emissions per \u00a3m normaliser \nentity value as defined above) by the size of our \ninvestment and aggregating all holdings in our \ninvestment portfolio.\nWe have applied the emissions data equally to \nequities and bonds as they are both used by \ncorporates to raise capital and fund the business.\nOur calculation methodology for our primary \neconomic carbon intensity metric aligns with:\n\u2022 PCAF stock emission intensity methodologies1 \n(that is to say using EVIC as the stock emission \nintensity normaliser), where available\n\u2022 TCFD\u2019s carbon footprint portfolio weighting \nmethodology2 (that is to say stock intensities \nare weighted by portfolio value).\nWhile standards are still emerging, we also provide \nan alternative flow-based WACI metric, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by the revenues of the \nunderlying entity in the case of corporate issuers, and \nGDP in the case of sovereigns, as aligned to TCFD\u2019s \nequivalent methodology. We also have started to track \nphysical carbon intensity metrics, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by a measure of physical \noutput, for certain asset class and sector subsets \nof the portfolio, in line with SBTi requirements3. \nFurther detail on the methodology, including the \nsourcing and application of the underlying data \nused in these metrics can be found in the additional \ninformation chapter on page 49. There are large \nsegments of our portfolio where we have to rely \non estimated rather than actual emissions data, \nor where there is no data at all. We are also reliant \non third party data.\nScope 3 investment portfolio economic carbon \nintensity: 2022 results\nTable 5 shows the December 2022 group investment \nportfolio GHG emission intensity score of 73 tCO2e/\u00a3m \ninvested (-5% in 2022; and -23% from the 2019 base year).\n \nWhen applied to the \u00a379.4 billion4 of assets in this \nanalysis, this gives an absolute footprint of 5.8 million \ntCO2e emissions (2021: 7.3 million tCO2e).\nWithin the annual movement in 2022, 2% is attributed \nto the change in updated portfolio emissions (from \nupdated company carbon disclosures, and from \ntrading activity) by holding EVIC constant, as shown \nin the table below. Our reported emissions in 2021 \nwere impacted by the pandemic and the resultant \nimpact on corporate and economic activity. This year \nwe have witnessed a partial reversal of this movement \ndue to lags in reporting of the underlying emissions \ndata, as expected. \nA reversal of this movement is then attributed \nto changes in the EVIC of the investments in 2022, \nillustrating the impact that market movements can \nhave on economic emission intensity metrics.\nTable 5.

For some key asset classes, \nasset class-specific approaches are employed, while \nfor others that are not covered in our datasets, we use \nsector-based proxies.

There are \nthree components to this metric:\n1. the GHG emissions, CO2e, in tonnes for each \nentity in which we are invested, arising from the \nunderlying scope 1 and 2 emissions \ndirectly connected with its operations\n2. a unit of value to normalise the emissions \nby the underlying size of the entity we are investing \nin, measured per \u00a3m. For our primary metric we use:\n\u2013 EVIC for corporate issuers\n\u2013 sovereign capital stock for sovereigns\n\u2013 market valuation for each real asset investment\n3. the size of our holding in the entity.\nThe investment portfolio emissions intensity is \nthen calculated by weighting the normalised emissions \n(tonnes of CO2e emissions per \u00a3m normaliser \nentity value as defined above) by the size of our \ninvestment and aggregating all holdings in our \ninvestment portfolio.\nWe have applied the emissions data equally to \nequities and bonds as they are both used by \ncorporates to raise capital and fund the business.\nOur calculation methodology for our primary \neconomic carbon intensity metric aligns with:\n\u2022 PCAF stock emission intensity methodologies1 \n(that is to say using EVIC as the stock emission \nintensity normaliser), where available\n\u2022 TCFD\u2019s carbon footprint portfolio weighting \nmethodology2 (that is to say stock intensities \nare weighted by portfolio value).\nWhile standards are still emerging, we also provide \nan alternative flow-based WACI metric, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by the revenues of the \nunderlying entity in the case of corporate issuers, and \nGDP in the case of sovereigns, as aligned to TCFD\u2019s \nequivalent methodology. We also have started to track \nphysical carbon intensity metrics, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by a measure of physical \noutput, for certain asset class and sector subsets \nof the portfolio, in line with SBTi requirements3. \nFurther detail on the methodology, including the \nsourcing and application of the underlying data \nused in these metrics can be found in the additional \ninformation chapter on page 49. There are large \nsegments of our portfolio where we have to rely \non estimated rather than actual emissions data, \nor where there is no data at all. We are also reliant \non third party data.\nScope 3 investment portfolio economic carbon \nintensity: 2022 results\nTable 5 shows the December 2022 group investment \nportfolio GHG emission intensity score of 73 tCO2e/\u00a3m \ninvested (-5% in 2022; and -23% from the 2019 base year).\n \nWhen applied to the \u00a379.4 billion4 of assets in this \nanalysis, this gives an absolute footprint of 5.8 million \ntCO2e emissions (2021: 7.3 million tCO2e).\nWithin the annual movement in 2022, 2% is attributed \nto the change in updated portfolio emissions (from \nupdated company carbon disclosures, and from \ntrading activity) by holding EVIC constant, as shown \nin the table below. Our reported emissions in 2021 \nwere impacted by the pandemic and the resultant \nimpact on corporate and economic activity. This year \nwe have witnessed a partial reversal of this movement \ndue to lags in reporting of the underlying emissions \ndata, as expected. \nA reversal of this movement is then attributed \nto changes in the EVIC of the investments in 2022, \nillustrating the impact that market movements can \nhave on economic emission intensity metrics.\nTable 5.

For some key asset classes, \nasset class-specific approaches are employed, while \nfor others that are not covered in our datasets, we use \nsector-based proxies.

There are \nthree components to this metric:\n1. the GHG emissions, CO2e, in tonnes for each \nentity in which we are invested, arising from the \nunderlying scope 1 and 2 emissions \ndirectly connected with its operations\n2. a unit of value to normalise the emissions \nby the underlying size of the entity we are investing \nin, measured per \u00a3m. For our primary metric we use:\n\u2013 EVIC for corporate issuers\n\u2013 sovereign capital stock for sovereigns\n\u2013 market valuation for each real asset investment\n3. the size of our holding in the entity.\nThe investment portfolio emissions intensity is \nthen calculated by weighting the normalised emissions \n(tonnes of CO2e emissions per \u00a3m normaliser \nentity value as defined above) by the size of our \ninvestment and aggregating all holdings in our \ninvestment portfolio.\nWe have applied the emissions data equally to \nequities and bonds as they are both used by \ncorporates to raise capital and fund the business.\nOur calculation methodology for our primary \neconomic carbon intensity metric aligns with:\n\u2022 PCAF stock emission intensity methodologies1 \n(that is to say using EVIC as the stock emission \nintensity normaliser), where available\n\u2022 TCFD\u2019s carbon footprint portfolio weighting \nmethodology2 (that is to say stock intensities \nare weighted by portfolio value).\nWhile standards are still emerging, we also provide \nan alternative flow-based WACI metric, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by the revenues of the \nunderlying entity in the case of corporate issuers, and \nGDP in the case of sovereigns, as aligned to TCFD\u2019s \nequivalent methodology. We also have started to track \nphysical carbon intensity metrics, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by a measure of physical \noutput, for certain asset class and sector subsets \nof the portfolio, in line with SBTi requirements3. \nFurther detail on the methodology, including the \nsourcing and application of the underlying data \nused in these metrics can be found in the additional \ninformation chapter on page 49. There are large \nsegments of our portfolio where we have to rely \non estimated rather than actual emissions data, \nor where there is no data at all. We are also reliant \non third party data.\nScope 3 investment portfolio economic carbon \nintensity: 2022 results\nTable 5 shows the December 2022 group investment \nportfolio GHG emission intensity score of 73 tCO2e/\u00a3m \ninvested (-5% in 2022; and -23% from the 2019 base year).\n \nWhen applied to the \u00a379.4 billion4 of assets in this \nanalysis, this gives an absolute footprint of 5.8 million \ntCO2e emissions (2021: 7.3 million tCO2e).\nWithin the annual movement in 2022, 2% is attributed \nto the change in updated portfolio emissions (from \nupdated company carbon disclosures, and from \ntrading activity) by holding EVIC constant, as shown \nin the table below. Our reported emissions in 2021 \nwere impacted by the pandemic and the resultant \nimpact on corporate and economic activity. This year \nwe have witnessed a partial reversal of this movement \ndue to lags in reporting of the underlying emissions \ndata, as expected. \nA reversal of this movement is then attributed \nto changes in the EVIC of the investments in 2022, \nillustrating the impact that market movements can \nhave on economic emission intensity metrics.\nTable 5.

For some key asset classes, \nasset class-specific approaches are employed, while \nfor others that are not covered in our datasets, we use \nsector-based proxies.

There are \nthree components to this metric:\n1. the GHG emissions, CO2e, in tonnes for each \nentity in which we are invested, arising from the \nunderlying scope 1 and 2 emissions \ndirectly connected with its operations\n2. a unit of value to normalise the emissions \nby the underlying size of the entity we are investing \nin, measured per \u00a3m. For our primary metric we use:\n\u2013 EVIC for corporate issuers\n\u2013 sovereign capital stock for sovereigns\n\u2013 market valuation for each real asset investment\n3. the size of our holding in the entity.\nThe investment portfolio emissions intensity is \nthen calculated by weighting the normalised emissions \n(tonnes of CO2e emissions per \u00a3m normaliser \nentity value as defined above) by the size of our \ninvestment and aggregating all holdings in our \ninvestment portfolio.\nWe have applied the emissions data equally to \nequities and bonds as they are both used by \ncorporates to raise capital and fund the business.\nOur calculation methodology for our primary \neconomic carbon intensity metric aligns with:\n\u2022 PCAF stock emission intensity methodologies1 \n(that is to say using EVIC as the stock emission \nintensity normaliser), where available\n\u2022 TCFD\u2019s carbon footprint portfolio weighting \nmethodology2 (that is to say stock intensities \nare weighted by portfolio value).\nWhile standards are still emerging, we also provide \nan alternative flow-based WACI metric, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by the revenues of the \nunderlying entity in the case of corporate issuers, and \nGDP in the case of sovereigns, as aligned to TCFD\u2019s \nequivalent methodology. We also have started to track \nphysical carbon intensity metrics, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by a measure of physical \noutput, for certain asset class and sector subsets \nof the portfolio, in line with SBTi requirements3. \nFurther detail on the methodology, including the \nsourcing and application of the underlying data \nused in these metrics can be found in the additional \ninformation chapter on page 49. There are large \nsegments of our portfolio where we have to rely \non estimated rather than actual emissions data, \nor where there is no data at all. We are also reliant \non third party data.\nScope 3 investment portfolio economic carbon \nintensity: 2022 results\nTable 5 shows the December 2022 group investment \nportfolio GHG emission intensity score of 73 tCO2e/\u00a3m \ninvested (-5% in 2022; and -23% from the 2019 base year).\n \nWhen applied to the \u00a379.4 billion4 of assets in this \nanalysis, this gives an absolute footprint of 5.8 million \ntCO2e emissions (2021: 7.3 million tCO2e).\nWithin the annual movement in 2022, 2% is attributed \nto the change in updated portfolio emissions (from \nupdated company carbon disclosures, and from \ntrading activity) by holding EVIC constant, as shown \nin the table below. Our reported emissions in 2021 \nwere impacted by the pandemic and the resultant \nimpact on corporate and economic activity. This year \nwe have witnessed a partial reversal of this movement \ndue to lags in reporting of the underlying emissions \ndata, as expected. \nA reversal of this movement is then attributed \nto changes in the EVIC of the investments in 2022, \nillustrating the impact that market movements can \nhave on economic emission intensity metrics.\nTable 5.

There are \nthree components to this metric:\n1. the GHG emissions, CO2e, in tonnes for each \nentity in which we are invested, arising from the \nunderlying scope 1 and 2 emissions \ndirectly connected with its operations\n2. a unit of value to normalise the emissions \nby the underlying size of the entity we are investing \nin, measured per \u00a3m. For our primary metric we use:\n\u2013 EVIC for corporate issuers\n\u2013 sovereign capital stock for sovereigns\n\u2013 market valuation for each real asset investment\n3. the size of our holding in the entity.\nThe investment portfolio emissions intensity is \nthen calculated by weighting the normalised emissions \n(tonnes of CO2e emissions per \u00a3m normaliser \nentity value as defined above) by the size of our \ninvestment and aggregating all holdings in our \ninvestment portfolio.\nWe have applied the emissions data equally to \nequities and bonds as they are both used by \ncorporates to raise capital and fund the business.\nOur calculation methodology for our primary \neconomic carbon intensity metric aligns with:\n\u2022 PCAF stock emission intensity methodologies1 \n(that is to say using EVIC as the stock emission \nintensity normaliser), where available\n\u2022 TCFD\u2019s carbon footprint portfolio weighting \nmethodology2 (that is to say stock intensities \nare weighted by portfolio value).\nWhile standards are still emerging, we also provide \nan alternative flow-based WACI metric, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by the revenues of the \nunderlying entity in the case of corporate issuers, and \nGDP in the case of sovereigns, as aligned to TCFD\u2019s \nequivalent methodology. We also have started to track \nphysical carbon intensity metrics, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by a measure of physical \noutput, for certain asset class and sector subsets \nof the portfolio, in line with SBTi requirements3. \nFurther detail on the methodology, including the \nsourcing and application of the underlying data \nused in these metrics can be found in the additional \ninformation chapter on page 49. There are large \nsegments of our portfolio where we have to rely \non estimated rather than actual emissions data, \nor where there is no data at all. We are also reliant \non third party data.\nScope 3 investment portfolio economic carbon \nintensity: 2022 results\nTable 5 shows the December 2022 group investment \nportfolio GHG emission intensity score of 73 tCO2e/\u00a3m \ninvested (-5% in 2022; and -23% from the 2019 base year).\n \nWhen applied to the \u00a379.4 billion4 of assets in this \nanalysis, this gives an absolute footprint of 5.8 million \ntCO2e emissions (2021: 7.3 million tCO2e).\nWithin the annual movement in 2022, 2% is attributed \nto the change in updated portfolio emissions (from \nupdated company carbon disclosures, and from \ntrading activity) by holding EVIC constant, as shown \nin the table below. Our reported emissions in 2021 \nwere impacted by the pandemic and the resultant \nimpact on corporate and economic activity. This year \nwe have witnessed a partial reversal of this movement \ndue to lags in reporting of the underlying emissions \ndata, as expected. \nA reversal of this movement is then attributed \nto changes in the EVIC of the investments in 2022, \nillustrating the impact that market movements can \nhave on economic emission intensity metrics.\nTable 5.

There are \nthree components to this metric:\n1. the GHG emissions, CO2e, in tonnes for each \nentity in which we are invested, arising from the \nunderlying scope 1 and 2 emissions \ndirectly connected with its operations\n2. a unit of value to normalise the emissions \nby the underlying size of the entity we are investing \nin, measured per \u00a3m. For our primary metric we use:\n\u2013 EVIC for corporate issuers\n\u2013 sovereign capital stock for sovereigns\n\u2013 market valuation for each real asset investment\n3. the size of our holding in the entity.\nThe investment portfolio emissions intensity is \nthen calculated by weighting the normalised emissions \n(tonnes of CO2e emissions per \u00a3m normaliser \nentity value as defined above) by the size of our \ninvestment and aggregating all holdings in our \ninvestment portfolio.\nWe have applied the emissions data equally to \nequities and bonds as they are both used by \ncorporates to raise capital and fund the business.\nOur calculation methodology for our primary \neconomic carbon intensity metric aligns with:\n\u2022 PCAF stock emission intensity methodologies1 \n(that is to say using EVIC as the stock emission \nintensity normaliser), where available\n\u2022 TCFD\u2019s carbon footprint portfolio weighting \nmethodology2 (that is to say stock intensities \nare weighted by portfolio value).\nWhile standards are still emerging, we also provide \nan alternative flow-based WACI metric, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by the revenues of the \nunderlying entity in the case of corporate issuers, and \nGDP in the case of sovereigns, as aligned to TCFD\u2019s \nequivalent methodology. We also have started to track \nphysical carbon intensity metrics, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by a measure of physical \noutput, for certain asset class and sector subsets \nof the portfolio, in line with SBTi requirements3. \nFurther detail on the methodology, including the \nsourcing and application of the underlying data \nused in these metrics can be found in the additional \ninformation chapter on page 49. There are large \nsegments of our portfolio where we have to rely \non estimated rather than actual emissions data, \nor where there is no data at all. We are also reliant \non third party data.\nScope 3 investment portfolio economic carbon \nintensity: 2022 results\nTable 5 shows the December 2022 group investment \nportfolio GHG emission intensity score of 73 tCO2e/\u00a3m \ninvested (-5% in 2022; and -23% from the 2019 base year).\n \nWhen applied to the \u00a379.4 billion4 of assets in this \nanalysis, this gives an absolute footprint of 5.8 million \ntCO2e emissions (2021: 7.3 million tCO2e).\nWithin the annual movement in 2022, 2% is attributed \nto the change in updated portfolio emissions (from \nupdated company carbon disclosures, and from \ntrading activity) by holding EVIC constant, as shown \nin the table below. Our reported emissions in 2021 \nwere impacted by the pandemic and the resultant \nimpact on corporate and economic activity. This year \nwe have witnessed a partial reversal of this movement \ndue to lags in reporting of the underlying emissions \ndata, as expected. \nA reversal of this movement is then attributed \nto changes in the EVIC of the investments in 2022, \nillustrating the impact that market movements can \nhave on economic emission intensity metrics.\nTable 5.

There are \nthree components to this metric:\n1. the GHG emissions, CO2e, in tonnes for each \nentity in which we are invested, arising from the \nunderlying scope 1 and 2 emissions \ndirectly connected with its operations\n2. a unit of value to normalise the emissions \nby the underlying size of the entity we are investing \nin, measured per \u00a3m. For our primary metric we use:\n\u2013 EVIC for corporate issuers\n\u2013 sovereign capital stock for sovereigns\n\u2013 market valuation for each real asset investment\n3. the size of our holding in the entity.\nThe investment portfolio emissions intensity is \nthen calculated by weighting the normalised emissions \n(tonnes of CO2e emissions per \u00a3m normaliser \nentity value as defined above) by the size of our \ninvestment and aggregating all holdings in our \ninvestment portfolio.\nWe have applied the emissions data equally to \nequities and bonds as they are both used by \ncorporates to raise capital and fund the business.\nOur calculation methodology for our primary \neconomic carbon intensity metric aligns with:\n\u2022 PCAF stock emission intensity methodologies1 \n(that is to say using EVIC as the stock emission \nintensity normaliser), where available\n\u2022 TCFD\u2019s carbon footprint portfolio weighting \nmethodology2 (that is to say stock intensities \nare weighted by portfolio value).\nWhile standards are still emerging, we also provide \nan alternative flow-based WACI metric, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by the revenues of the \nunderlying entity in the case of corporate issuers, and \nGDP in the case of sovereigns, as aligned to TCFD\u2019s \nequivalent methodology. We also have started to track \nphysical carbon intensity metrics, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by a measure of physical \noutput, for certain asset class and sector subsets \nof the portfolio, in line with SBTi requirements3. \nFurther detail on the methodology, including the \nsourcing and application of the underlying data \nused in these metrics can be found in the additional \ninformation chapter on page 49. There are large \nsegments of our portfolio where we have to rely \non estimated rather than actual emissions data, \nor where there is no data at all. We are also reliant \non third party data.\nScope 3 investment portfolio economic carbon \nintensity: 2022 results\nTable 5 shows the December 2022 group investment \nportfolio GHG emission intensity score of 73 tCO2e/\u00a3m \ninvested (-5% in 2022; and -23% from the 2019 base year).\n \nWhen applied to the \u00a379.4 billion4 of assets in this \nanalysis, this gives an absolute footprint of 5.8 million \ntCO2e emissions (2021: 7.3 million tCO2e).\nWithin the annual movement in 2022, 2% is attributed \nto the change in updated portfolio emissions (from \nupdated company carbon disclosures, and from \ntrading activity) by holding EVIC constant, as shown \nin the table below. Our reported emissions in 2021 \nwere impacted by the pandemic and the resultant \nimpact on corporate and economic activity. This year \nwe have witnessed a partial reversal of this movement \ndue to lags in reporting of the underlying emissions \ndata, as expected. \nA reversal of this movement is then attributed \nto changes in the EVIC of the investments in 2022, \nillustrating the impact that market movements can \nhave on economic emission intensity metrics.\nTable 5.

For some key asset classes, \nasset class-specific approaches are employed, while \nfor others that are not covered in our datasets, we use \nsector-based proxies.

For our primary metric we use:\n\u2013 EVIC for corporate issuers\n\u2013 sovereign capital stock for sovereigns\n\u2013 market valuation for each real asset investment\n3. the size of our holding in the entity.\nThe investment portfolio emissions intensity is \nthen calculated by weighting the normalised emissions \n(tonnes of CO2e emissions per \u00a3m normaliser \nentity value as defined above) by the size of our \ninvestment and aggregating all holdings in our \ninvestment portfolio.\nWe have applied the emissions data equally to \nequities and bonds as they are both used by \ncorporates to raise capital and fund the business.\nOur calculation methodology for our primary \neconomic carbon intensity metric aligns with:\n\u2022 PCAF stock emission intensity methodologies1 \n(that is to say using EVIC as the stock emission \nintensity normaliser), where available\n\u2022 TCFD\u2019s carbon footprint portfolio weighting \nmethodology2 (that is to say stock intensities \nare weighted by portfolio value).\nWhile standards are still emerging, we also provide \nan alternative flow-based WACI metric, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by the revenues of the \nunderlying entity in the case of corporate issuers, and \nGDP in the case of sovereigns, as aligned to TCFD\u2019s \nequivalent methodology.

There are \nthree components to this metric:\n1. the GHG emissions, CO2e, in tonnes for each \nentity in which we are invested, arising from the \nunderlying scope 1 and 2 emissions \ndirectly connected with its operations\n2. a unit of value to normalise the emissions \nby the underlying size of the entity we are investing \nin, measured per \u00a3m. For our primary metric we use:\n\u2013 EVIC for corporate issuers\n\u2013 sovereign capital stock for sovereigns\n\u2013 market valuation for each real asset investment\n3. the size of our holding in the entity.\nThe investment portfolio emissions intensity is \nthen calculated by weighting the normalised emissions \n(tonnes of CO2e emissions per \u00a3m normaliser \nentity value as defined above) by the size of our \ninvestment and aggregating all holdings in our \ninvestment portfolio.\nWe have applied the emissions data equally to \nequities and bonds as they are both used by \ncorporates to raise capital and fund the business.\nOur calculation methodology for our primary \neconomic carbon intensity metric aligns with:\n\u2022 PCAF stock emission intensity methodologies1 \n(that is to say using EVIC as the stock emission \nintensity normaliser), where available\n\u2022 TCFD\u2019s carbon footprint portfolio weighting \nmethodology2 (that is to say stock intensities \nare weighted by portfolio value).\nWhile standards are still emerging, we also provide \nan alternative flow-based WACI metric, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by the revenues of the \nunderlying entity in the case of corporate issuers, and \nGDP in the case of sovereigns, as aligned to TCFD\u2019s \nequivalent methodology. We also have started to track \nphysical carbon intensity metrics, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by a measure of physical \noutput, for certain asset class and sector subsets \nof the portfolio, in line with SBTi requirements3. \nFurther detail on the methodology, including the \nsourcing and application of the underlying data \nused in these metrics can be found in the additional \ninformation chapter on page 49. There are large \nsegments of our portfolio where we have to rely \non estimated rather than actual emissions data, \nor where there is no data at all. We are also reliant \non third party data.\nScope 3 investment portfolio economic carbon \nintensity: 2022 results\nTable 5 shows the December 2022 group investment \nportfolio GHG emission intensity score of 73 tCO2e/\u00a3m \ninvested (-5% in 2022; and -23% from the 2019 base year).\n \nWhen applied to the \u00a379.4 billion4 of assets in this \nanalysis, this gives an absolute footprint of 5.8 million \ntCO2e emissions (2021: 7.3 million tCO2e).\nWithin the annual movement in 2022, 2% is attributed \nto the change in updated portfolio emissions (from \nupdated company carbon disclosures, and from \ntrading activity) by holding EVIC constant, as shown \nin the table below. Our reported emissions in 2021 \nwere impacted by the pandemic and the resultant \nimpact on corporate and economic activity. This year \nwe have witnessed a partial reversal of this movement \ndue to lags in reporting of the underlying emissions \ndata, as expected. \nA reversal of this movement is then attributed \nto changes in the EVIC of the investments in 2022, \nillustrating the impact that market movements can \nhave on economic emission intensity metrics.\nTable 5.

For some key asset classes, \nasset class-specific approaches are employed, while \nfor others that are not covered in our datasets, we use \nsector-based proxies.

There are \nthree components to this metric:\n1. the GHG emissions, CO2e, in tonnes for each \nentity in which we are invested, arising from the \nunderlying scope 1 and 2 emissions \ndirectly connected with its operations\n2. a unit of value to normalise the emissions \nby the underlying size of the entity we are investing \nin, measured per \u00a3m. For our primary metric we use:\n\u2013 EVIC for corporate issuers\n\u2013 sovereign capital stock for sovereigns\n\u2013 market valuation for each real asset investment\n3. the size of our holding in the entity.\nThe investment portfolio emissions intensity is \nthen calculated by weighting the normalised emissions \n(tonnes of CO2e emissions per \u00a3m normaliser \nentity value as defined above) by the size of our \ninvestment and aggregating all holdings in our \ninvestment portfolio.\nWe have applied the emissions data equally to \nequities and bonds as they are both used by \ncorporates to raise capital and fund the business.\nOur calculation methodology for our primary \neconomic carbon intensity metric aligns with:\n\u2022 PCAF stock emission intensity methodologies1 \n(that is to say using EVIC as the stock emission \nintensity normaliser), where available\n\u2022 TCFD\u2019s carbon footprint portfolio weighting \nmethodology2 (that is to say stock intensities \nare weighted by portfolio value).\nWhile standards are still emerging, we also provide \nan alternative flow-based WACI metric, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by the revenues of the \nunderlying entity in the case of corporate issuers, and \nGDP in the case of sovereigns, as aligned to TCFD\u2019s \nequivalent methodology. We also have started to track \nphysical carbon intensity metrics, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by a measure of physical \noutput, for certain asset class and sector subsets \nof the portfolio, in line with SBTi requirements3. \nFurther detail on the methodology, including the \nsourcing and application of the underlying data \nused in these metrics can be found in the additional \ninformation chapter on page 49. There are large \nsegments of our portfolio where we have to rely \non estimated rather than actual emissions data, \nor where there is no data at all. We are also reliant \non third party data.\nScope 3 investment portfolio economic carbon \nintensity: 2022 results\nTable 5 shows the December 2022 group investment \nportfolio GHG emission intensity score of 73 tCO2e/\u00a3m \ninvested (-5% in 2022; and -23% from the 2019 base year).\n \nWhen applied to the \u00a379.4 billion4 of assets in this \nanalysis, this gives an absolute footprint of 5.8 million \ntCO2e emissions (2021: 7.3 million tCO2e).\nWithin the annual movement in 2022, 2% is attributed \nto the change in updated portfolio emissions (from \nupdated company carbon disclosures, and from \ntrading activity) by holding EVIC constant, as shown \nin the table below. Our reported emissions in 2021 \nwere impacted by the pandemic and the resultant \nimpact on corporate and economic activity. This year \nwe have witnessed a partial reversal of this movement \ndue to lags in reporting of the underlying emissions \ndata, as expected. \nA reversal of this movement is then attributed \nto changes in the EVIC of the investments in 2022, \nillustrating the impact that market movements can \nhave on economic emission intensity metrics.\nTable 5.

There are \nthree components to this metric:\n1. the GHG emissions, CO2e, in tonnes for each \nentity in which we are invested, arising from the \nunderlying scope 1 and 2 emissions \ndirectly connected with its operations\n2. a unit of value to normalise the emissions \nby the underlying size of the entity we are investing \nin, measured per \u00a3m. For our primary metric we use:\n\u2013 EVIC for corporate issuers\n\u2013 sovereign capital stock for sovereigns\n\u2013 market valuation for each real asset investment\n3. the size of our holding in the entity.\nThe investment portfolio emissions intensity is \nthen calculated by weighting the normalised emissions \n(tonnes of CO2e emissions per \u00a3m normaliser \nentity value as defined above) by the size of our \ninvestment and aggregating all holdings in our \ninvestment portfolio.\nWe have applied the emissions data equally to \nequities and bonds as they are both used by \ncorporates to raise capital and fund the business.\nOur calculation methodology for our primary \neconomic carbon intensity metric aligns with:\n\u2022 PCAF stock emission intensity methodologies1 \n(that is to say using EVIC as the stock emission \nintensity normaliser), where available\n\u2022 TCFD\u2019s carbon footprint portfolio weighting \nmethodology2 (that is to say stock intensities \nare weighted by portfolio value).\nWhile standards are still emerging, we also provide \nan alternative flow-based WACI metric, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by the revenues of the \nunderlying entity in the case of corporate issuers, and \nGDP in the case of sovereigns, as aligned to TCFD\u2019s \nequivalent methodology. We also have started to track \nphysical carbon intensity metrics, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by a measure of physical \noutput, for certain asset class and sector subsets \nof the portfolio, in line with SBTi requirements3. \nFurther detail on the methodology, including the \nsourcing and application of the underlying data \nused in these metrics can be found in the additional \ninformation chapter on page 49. There are large \nsegments of our portfolio where we have to rely \non estimated rather than actual emissions data, \nor where there is no data at all. We are also reliant \non third party data.\nScope 3 investment portfolio economic carbon \nintensity: 2022 results\nTable 5 shows the December 2022 group investment \nportfolio GHG emission intensity score of 73 tCO2e/\u00a3m \ninvested (-5% in 2022; and -23% from the 2019 base year).\n \nWhen applied to the \u00a379.4 billion4 of assets in this \nanalysis, this gives an absolute footprint of 5.8 million \ntCO2e emissions (2021: 7.3 million tCO2e).\nWithin the annual movement in 2022, 2% is attributed \nto the change in updated portfolio emissions (from \nupdated company carbon disclosures, and from \ntrading activity) by holding EVIC constant, as shown \nin the table below. Our reported emissions in 2021 \nwere impacted by the pandemic and the resultant \nimpact on corporate and economic activity. This year \nwe have witnessed a partial reversal of this movement \ndue to lags in reporting of the underlying emissions \ndata, as expected. \nA reversal of this movement is then attributed \nto changes in the EVIC of the investments in 2022, \nillustrating the impact that market movements can \nhave on economic emission intensity metrics.\nTable 5.

There are \nthree components to this metric:\n1. the GHG emissions, CO2e, in tonnes for each \nentity in which we are invested, arising from the \nunderlying scope 1 and 2 emissions \ndirectly connected with its operations\n2. a unit of value to normalise the emissions \nby the underlying size of the entity we are investing \nin, measured per \u00a3m. For our primary metric we use:\n\u2013 EVIC for corporate issuers\n\u2013 sovereign capital stock for sovereigns\n\u2013 market valuation for each real asset investment\n3. the size of our holding in the entity.\nThe investment portfolio emissions intensity is \nthen calculated by weighting the normalised emissions \n(tonnes of CO2e emissions per \u00a3m normaliser \nentity value as defined above) by the size of our \ninvestment and aggregating all holdings in our \ninvestment portfolio.\nWe have applied the emissions data equally to \nequities and bonds as they are both used by \ncorporates to raise capital and fund the business.\nOur calculation methodology for our primary \neconomic carbon intensity metric aligns with:\n\u2022 PCAF stock emission intensity methodologies1 \n(that is to say using EVIC as the stock emission \nintensity normaliser), where available\n\u2022 TCFD\u2019s carbon footprint portfolio weighting \nmethodology2 (that is to say stock intensities \nare weighted by portfolio value).\nWhile standards are still emerging, we also provide \nan alternative flow-based WACI metric, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by the revenues of the \nunderlying entity in the case of corporate issuers, and \nGDP in the case of sovereigns, as aligned to TCFD\u2019s \nequivalent methodology. We also have started to track \nphysical carbon intensity metrics, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by a measure of physical \noutput, for certain asset class and sector subsets \nof the portfolio, in line with SBTi requirements3. \nFurther detail on the methodology, including the \nsourcing and application of the underlying data \nused in these metrics can be found in the additional \ninformation chapter on page 49. There are large \nsegments of our portfolio where we have to rely \non estimated rather than actual emissions data, \nor where there is no data at all.

There are \nthree components to this metric:\n1. the GHG emissions, CO2e, in tonnes for each \nentity in which we are invested, arising from the \nunderlying scope 1 and 2 emissions \ndirectly connected with its operations\n2. a unit of value to normalise the emissions \nby the underlying size of the entity we are investing \nin, measured per \u00a3m. For our primary metric we use:\n\u2013 EVIC for corporate issuers\n\u2013 sovereign capital stock for sovereigns\n\u2013 market valuation for each real asset investment\n3. the size of our holding in the entity.\nThe investment portfolio emissions intensity is \nthen calculated by weighting the normalised emissions \n(tonnes of CO2e emissions per \u00a3m normaliser \nentity value as defined above) by the size of our \ninvestment and aggregating all holdings in our \ninvestment portfolio.\nWe have applied the emissions data equally to \nequities and bonds as they are both used by \ncorporates to raise capital and fund the business.\nOur calculation methodology for our primary \neconomic carbon intensity metric aligns with:\n\u2022 PCAF stock emission intensity methodologies1 \n(that is to say using EVIC as the stock emission \nintensity normaliser), where available\n\u2022 TCFD\u2019s carbon footprint portfolio weighting \nmethodology2 (that is to say stock intensities \nare weighted by portfolio value).\nWhile standards are still emerging, we also provide \nan alternative flow-based WACI metric, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by the revenues of the \nunderlying entity in the case of corporate issuers, and \nGDP in the case of sovereigns, as aligned to TCFD\u2019s \nequivalent methodology. We also have started to track \nphysical carbon intensity metrics, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by a measure of physical \noutput, for certain asset class and sector subsets \nof the portfolio, in line with SBTi requirements3. \nFurther detail on the methodology, including the \nsourcing and application of the underlying data \nused in these metrics can be found in the additional \ninformation chapter on page 49.

There are \nthree components to this metric:\n1. the GHG emissions, CO2e, in tonnes for each \nentity in which we are invested, arising from the \nunderlying scope 1 and 2 emissions \ndirectly connected with its operations\n2. a unit of value to normalise the emissions \nby the underlying size of the entity we are investing \nin, measured per \u00a3m. For our primary metric we use:\n\u2013 EVIC for corporate issuers\n\u2013 sovereign capital stock for sovereigns\n\u2013 market valuation for each real asset investment\n3. the size of our holding in the entity.\nThe investment portfolio emissions intensity is \nthen calculated by weighting the normalised emissions \n(tonnes of CO2e emissions per \u00a3m normaliser \nentity value as defined above) by the size of our \ninvestment and aggregating all holdings in our \ninvestment portfolio.\nWe have applied the emissions data equally to \nequities and bonds as they are both used by \ncorporates to raise capital and fund the business.\nOur calculation methodology for our primary \neconomic carbon intensity metric aligns with:\n\u2022 PCAF stock emission intensity methodologies1 \n(that is to say using EVIC as the stock emission \nintensity normaliser), where available\n\u2022 TCFD\u2019s carbon footprint portfolio weighting \nmethodology2 (that is to say stock intensities \nare weighted by portfolio value).\nWhile standards are still emerging, we also provide \nan alternative flow-based WACI metric, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by the revenues of the \nunderlying entity in the case of corporate issuers, and \nGDP in the case of sovereigns, as aligned to TCFD\u2019s \nequivalent methodology. We also have started to track \nphysical carbon intensity metrics, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by a measure of physical \noutput, for certain asset class and sector subsets \nof the portfolio, in line with SBTi requirements3. \nFurther detail on the methodology, including the \nsourcing and application of the underlying data \nused in these metrics can be found in the additional \ninformation chapter on page 49. There are large \nsegments of our portfolio where we have to rely \non estimated rather than actual emissions data, \nor where there is no data at all. We are also reliant \non third party data.\nScope 3 investment portfolio economic carbon \nintensity: 2022 results\nTable 5 shows the December 2022 group investment \nportfolio GHG emission intensity score of 73 tCO2e/\u00a3m \ninvested (-5% in 2022; and -23% from the 2019 base year).\n \nWhen applied to the \u00a379.4 billion4 of assets in this \nanalysis, this gives an absolute footprint of 5.8 million \ntCO2e emissions (2021: 7.3 million tCO2e).\nWithin the annual movement in 2022, 2% is attributed \nto the change in updated portfolio emissions (from \nupdated company carbon disclosures, and from \ntrading activity) by holding EVIC constant, as shown \nin the table below. Our reported emissions in 2021 \nwere impacted by the pandemic and the resultant \nimpact on corporate and economic activity. This year \nwe have witnessed a partial reversal of this movement \ndue to lags in reporting of the underlying emissions \ndata, as expected. \nA reversal of this movement is then attributed \nto changes in the EVIC of the investments in 2022, \nillustrating the impact that market movements can \nhave on economic emission intensity metrics.\nTable 5.

There are \nthree components to this metric:\n1. the GHG emissions, CO2e, in tonnes for each \nentity in which we are invested, arising from the \nunderlying scope 1 and 2 emissions \ndirectly connected with its operations\n2. a unit of value to normalise the emissions \nby the underlying size of the entity we are investing \nin, measured per \u00a3m. For our primary metric we use:\n\u2013 EVIC for corporate issuers\n\u2013 sovereign capital stock for sovereigns\n\u2013 market valuation for each real asset investment\n3. the size of our holding in the entity.\nThe investment portfolio emissions intensity is \nthen calculated by weighting the normalised emissions \n(tonnes of CO2e emissions per \u00a3m normaliser \nentity value as defined above) by the size of our \ninvestment and aggregating all holdings in our \ninvestment portfolio.\nWe have applied the emissions data equally to \nequities and bonds as they are both used by \ncorporates to raise capital and fund the business.\nOur calculation methodology for our primary \neconomic carbon intensity metric aligns with:\n\u2022 PCAF stock emission intensity methodologies1 \n(that is to say using EVIC as the stock emission \nintensity normaliser), where available\n\u2022 TCFD\u2019s carbon footprint portfolio weighting \nmethodology2 (that is to say stock intensities \nare weighted by portfolio value).\nWhile standards are still emerging, we also provide \nan alternative flow-based WACI metric, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by the revenues of the \nunderlying entity in the case of corporate issuers, and \nGDP in the case of sovereigns, as aligned to TCFD\u2019s \nequivalent methodology. We also have started to track \nphysical carbon intensity metrics, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by a measure of physical \noutput, for certain asset class and sector subsets \nof the portfolio, in line with SBTi requirements3. \nFurther detail on the methodology, including the \nsourcing and application of the underlying data \nused in these metrics can be found in the additional \ninformation chapter on page 49. There are large \nsegments of our portfolio where we have to rely \non estimated rather than actual emissions data, \nor where there is no data at all. We are also reliant \non third party data.\nScope 3 investment portfolio economic carbon \nintensity: 2022 results\nTable 5 shows the December 2022 group investment \nportfolio GHG emission intensity score of 73 tCO2e/\u00a3m \ninvested (-5% in 2022; and -23% from the 2019 base year).\n \nWhen applied to the \u00a379.4 billion4 of assets in this \nanalysis, this gives an absolute footprint of 5.8 million \ntCO2e emissions (2021: 7.3 million tCO2e).\nWithin the annual movement in 2022, 2% is attributed \nto the change in updated portfolio emissions (from \nupdated company carbon disclosures, and from \ntrading activity) by holding EVIC constant, as shown \nin the table below. Our reported emissions in 2021 \nwere impacted by the pandemic and the resultant \nimpact on corporate and economic activity. This year \nwe have witnessed a partial reversal of this movement \ndue to lags in reporting of the underlying emissions \ndata, as expected. \nA reversal of this movement is then attributed \nto changes in the EVIC of the investments in 2022, \nillustrating the impact that market movements can \nhave on economic emission intensity metrics.\nTable 5.

There are \nthree components to this metric:\n1. the GHG emissions, CO2e, in tonnes for each \nentity in which we are invested, arising from the \nunderlying scope 1 and 2 emissions \ndirectly connected with its operations\n2. a unit of value to normalise the emissions \nby the underlying size of the entity we are investing \nin, measured per \u00a3m. For our primary metric we use:\n\u2013 EVIC for corporate issuers\n\u2013 sovereign capital stock for sovereigns\n\u2013 market valuation for each real asset investment\n3. the size of our holding in the entity.\nThe investment portfolio emissions intensity is \nthen calculated by weighting the normalised emissions \n(tonnes of CO2e emissions per \u00a3m normaliser \nentity value as defined above) by the size of our \ninvestment and aggregating all holdings in our \ninvestment portfolio.\nWe have applied the emissions data equally to \nequities and bonds as they are both used by \ncorporates to raise capital and fund the business.\nOur calculation methodology for our primary \neconomic carbon intensity metric aligns with:\n\u2022 PCAF stock emission intensity methodologies1 \n(that is to say using EVIC as the stock emission \nintensity normaliser), where available\n\u2022 TCFD\u2019s carbon footprint portfolio weighting \nmethodology2 (that is to say stock intensities \nare weighted by portfolio value).\nWhile standards are still emerging, we also provide \nan alternative flow-based WACI metric, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by the revenues of the \nunderlying entity in the case of corporate issuers, and \nGDP in the case of sovereigns, as aligned to TCFD\u2019s \nequivalent methodology. We also have started to track \nphysical carbon intensity metrics, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by a measure of physical \noutput, for certain asset class and sector subsets \nof the portfolio, in line with SBTi requirements3. \nFurther detail on the methodology, including the \nsourcing and application of the underlying data \nused in these metrics can be found in the additional \ninformation chapter on page 49. There are large \nsegments of our portfolio where we have to rely \non estimated rather than actual emissions data, \nor where there is no data at all. We are also reliant \non third party data.\nScope 3 investment portfolio economic carbon \nintensity: 2022 results\nTable 5 shows the December 2022 group investment \nportfolio GHG emission intensity score of 73 tCO2e/\u00a3m \ninvested (-5% in 2022; and -23% from the 2019 base year).\n \nWhen applied to the \u00a379.4 billion4 of assets in this \nanalysis, this gives an absolute footprint of 5.8 million \ntCO2e emissions (2021: 7.3 million tCO2e).\nWithin the annual movement in 2022, 2% is attributed \nto the change in updated portfolio emissions (from \nupdated company carbon disclosures, and from \ntrading activity) by holding EVIC constant, as shown \nin the table below. Our reported emissions in 2021 \nwere impacted by the pandemic and the resultant \nimpact on corporate and economic activity. This year \nwe have witnessed a partial reversal of this movement \ndue to lags in reporting of the underlying emissions \ndata, as expected. \nA reversal of this movement is then attributed \nto changes in the EVIC of the investments in 2022, \nillustrating the impact that market movements can \nhave on economic emission intensity metrics.\nTable 5.

There are \nthree components to this metric:\n1. the GHG emissions, CO2e, in tonnes for each \nentity in which we are invested, arising from the \nunderlying scope 1 and 2 emissions \ndirectly connected with its operations\n2. a unit of value to normalise the emissions \nby the underlying size of the entity we are investing \nin, measured per \u00a3m. For our primary metric we use:\n\u2013 EVIC for corporate issuers\n\u2013 sovereign capital stock for sovereigns\n\u2013 market valuation for each real asset investment\n3. the size of our holding in the entity.\nThe investment portfolio emissions intensity is \nthen calculated by weighting the normalised emissions \n(tonnes of CO2e emissions per \u00a3m normaliser \nentity value as defined above) by the size of our \ninvestment and aggregating all holdings in our \ninvestment portfolio.\nWe have applied the emissions data equally to \nequities and bonds as they are both used by \ncorporates to raise capital and fund the business.\nOur calculation methodology for our primary \neconomic carbon intensity metric aligns with:\n\u2022 PCAF stock emission intensity methodologies1 \n(that is to say using EVIC as the stock emission \nintensity normaliser), where available\n\u2022 TCFD\u2019s carbon footprint portfolio weighting \nmethodology2 (that is to say stock intensities \nare weighted by portfolio value).\nWhile standards are still emerging, we also provide \nan alternative flow-based WACI metric, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by the revenues of the \nunderlying entity in the case of corporate issuers, and \nGDP in the case of sovereigns, as aligned to TCFD\u2019s \nequivalent methodology. We also have started to track \nphysical carbon intensity metrics, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by a measure of physical \noutput, for certain asset class and sector subsets \nof the portfolio, in line with SBTi requirements3. \nFurther detail on the methodology, including the \nsourcing and application of the underlying data \nused in these metrics can be found in the additional \ninformation chapter on page 49. There are large \nsegments of our portfolio where we have to rely \non estimated rather than actual emissions data, \nor where there is no data at all. We are also reliant \non third party data.\nScope 3 investment portfolio economic carbon \nintensity: 2022 results\nTable 5 shows the December 2022 group investment \nportfolio GHG emission intensity score of 73 tCO2e/\u00a3m \ninvested (-5% in 2022; and -23% from the 2019 base year).\n \nWhen applied to the \u00a379.4 billion4 of assets in this \nanalysis, this gives an absolute footprint of 5.8 million \ntCO2e emissions (2021: 7.3 million tCO2e).\nWithin the annual movement in 2022, 2% is attributed \nto the change in updated portfolio emissions (from \nupdated company carbon disclosures, and from \ntrading activity) by holding EVIC constant, as shown \nin the table below. Our reported emissions in 2021 \nwere impacted by the pandemic and the resultant \nimpact on corporate and economic activity. This year \nwe have witnessed a partial reversal of this movement \ndue to lags in reporting of the underlying emissions \ndata, as expected. \nA reversal of this movement is then attributed \nto changes in the EVIC of the investments in 2022, \nillustrating the impact that market movements can \nhave on economic emission intensity metrics.\nTable 5.

There are \nthree components to this metric:\n1. the GHG emissions, CO2e, in tonnes for each \nentity in which we are invested, arising from the \nunderlying scope 1 and 2 emissions \ndirectly connected with its operations\n2. a unit of value to normalise the emissions \nby the underlying size of the entity we are investing \nin, measured per \u00a3m. For our primary metric we use:\n\u2013 EVIC for corporate issuers\n\u2013 sovereign capital stock for sovereigns\n\u2013 market valuation for each real asset investment\n3. the size of our holding in the entity.\nThe investment portfolio emissions intensity is \nthen calculated by weighting the normalised emissions \n(tonnes of CO2e emissions per \u00a3m normaliser \nentity value as defined above) by the size of our \ninvestment and aggregating all holdings in our \ninvestment portfolio.\nWe have applied the emissions data equally to \nequities and bonds as they are both used by \ncorporates to raise capital and fund the business.\nOur calculation methodology for our primary \neconomic carbon intensity metric aligns with:\n\u2022 PCAF stock emission intensity methodologies1 \n(that is to say using EVIC as the stock emission \nintensity normaliser), where available\n\u2022 TCFD\u2019s carbon footprint portfolio weighting \nmethodology2 (that is to say stock intensities \nare weighted by portfolio value).\nWhile standards are still emerging, we also provide \nan alternative flow-based WACI metric, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by the revenues of the \nunderlying entity in the case of corporate issuers, and \nGDP in the case of sovereigns, as aligned to TCFD\u2019s \nequivalent methodology. We also have started to track \nphysical carbon intensity metrics, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by a measure of physical \noutput, for certain asset class and sector subsets \nof the portfolio, in line with SBTi requirements3. \nFurther detail on the methodology, including the \nsourcing and application of the underlying data \nused in these metrics can be found in the additional \ninformation chapter on page 49. There are large \nsegments of our portfolio where we have to rely \non estimated rather than actual emissions data, \nor where there is no data at all. We are also reliant \non third party data.\nScope 3 investment portfolio economic carbon \nintensity: 2022 results\nTable 5 shows the December 2022 group investment \nportfolio GHG emission intensity score of 73 tCO2e/\u00a3m \ninvested (-5% in 2022; and -23% from the 2019 base year).\n \nWhen applied to the \u00a379.4 billion4 of assets in this \nanalysis, this gives an absolute footprint of 5.8 million \ntCO2e emissions (2021: 7.3 million tCO2e).\nWithin the annual movement in 2022, 2% is attributed \nto the change in updated portfolio emissions (from \nupdated company carbon disclosures, and from \ntrading activity) by holding EVIC constant, as shown \nin the table below. Our reported emissions in 2021 \nwere impacted by the pandemic and the resultant \nimpact on corporate and economic activity. This year \nwe have witnessed a partial reversal of this movement \ndue to lags in reporting of the underlying emissions \ndata, as expected. \nA reversal of this movement is then attributed \nto changes in the EVIC of the investments in 2022, \nillustrating the impact that market movements can \nhave on economic emission intensity metrics.\nTable 5.
