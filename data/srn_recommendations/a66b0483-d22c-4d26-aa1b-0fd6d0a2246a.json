Due to incomplete data from suppliers, Getinge does \nnot report its market based GHG emissions in 2022, but strives to \nGas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard \n(Revised Edition). \nGetinge calculates Scope 3 GHG emissions in accordance with \nthe GHG Protocol: Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting \nand Reporting Standard. Scope 3 GHG emissions are defined as \nall other indirect emissions that occur in a company\u2019s value chain. \nThe GHG Protocol Standard includes 15 categories of Scope 3 GHG \nemissions that organizations are required to report. \nMaterial categories for Scope 3 GHG emissions reporting are \ndetermined using the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope \n3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. \nWith regards to scope 3, the main achievement during 2022 has \nbeen the analysis of all 15 categories of emissions and establishing \na baseline from 2021 to be able to set Science Based Targets. The \ncategories which have the largest impact on emissions in the value \nchain are sourcing of materials (~30%), distribution and logistics \n(~10%) and the use of products (~45%).\nBased on Getinge\u2019s commitment to the Science Based Targets \ninitiative (SBTi), Getinge has defined its emission reduction targets \nand submitted the baseline for validation by the SBTi in 2022.\nGetinge\u2019s Scope 3 emissions baseline 2021 has been estimated \nusing the spend based approach. For 2022, Getinge strives to \nswitch to a weights\u00adbased approach, including information from \nour suppliers, consultants, and conversion factors sourced from \npublicly available databases. \nGetinge will report Scope 3 emission figures after validation of \nthe targets and baseline by the SBTi in 2023. \nRECs (Renewable Energy Certificate) is a type of Energy Attribute \nCertificate (EAC) that represents the environmental attributes of \nthe generation of a one\u00admegawatt hour (MWh) of energy produced \nby renewable sources. Using EACs, end\u00adusers around the world \ncan make reliable claims about their energy usage from renewable \nsources. As RECs are accepted by SBTi/GHG Protocol, purchasing \nRECs is not regarded as \u201coffseting\u201d at Getinge. \nIn 2022, switching to certified carbon neutral energy products \n(i.e. via RECs) has accounted for 22% (2,351 tons CO2e) of the over \nall emission reduction in Scope 1 & 2  in production.\nCarbon Credits, Verified Carbon Units or VCUs\nEach VCU represents a reduction or removal of one tonne of carbon \ndioxide equivalent (CO2e) achieved by a project, but do not contrib\u00ad\nute to the increase of energy production from renewable sources. \nTherefore, carbon credits are not accepted as emission reduction \nby the SBTi. At Getinge, the purchase of carbon certificates to \nneutralize emissions from non\u00adrenewable sources is regarded as \n\u201coffseting\u201d. It helps to neutralize emissions as an interim solution \nwhile plans are implemented to increase energy efficiency, reduce \nenergy consumption and switch to renewable energy sourcing \nwherever possible. \nLocal emission reductions based on this approach are not \nincluded in the company reporting of emission reductions. Energy \nconsumption from non\u00adrenewable sources is reported as such.\nCalculation of emissions from vehicles\nGetinge\u2019s fleet consists of 100% leased vehicles.

The FTE is a shared definition with Finance, designed to strike \nan effective and easy to use balance between the employee cost \nside and the amount of productive hands.

Data is reported over the \nperiod of a year for people being hired during 2022 or having their \nlast day of contract in 2022.\nFor both terminations and hires, the numbers are presented in \nFTE. The definition is similar to the one described in 2.7 with the \nfollowing exceptions\n1.   Only permanent employees are counted in the numerator  \nand denominator, excluding the small number of temporary \nemployees. This is company standard to avoid cluttering the  \ndata with terminations due to planned end of contract.\n2.   Employees that are active, on paid leave (as for 2.7) but also \npeople on unpaid leave are included to ensure all employees  \nare counted for.\nGender data is allowing for selecting other categories than \u201cMale\u201d \nor \u201cFemale\u201d. These are here presented combined under \u201cOther\u201d due \nto the low number employees in these categories.

If date of birth is missing or \nincorrect, it is recorded as invalid in the above. Governing bodies \nare defined as employees that have managerial responsibility over \nother employees \u2013 internal or external. No other minority data is \navailable.\nGRI 401-2 Parental leave\nThe presented data is extracted from the Getinge Global Human \nResource Information System (HRIS). Data is reported over the \nperiod of a year for people going on leave or returning from leave.\nAny kind of parental leave is per default handled locally accord\u00ad\ning to local rules, regulation and contract, hence the global data on \nthis is scarce and difficult to report on. Any parental leave is man\u00ad\ndated to be recorded in the global HRIS system if either expecting \nto last or actual lasting more than 14 calendar days. Exception \nto this is the US that does a pay roll integration following local \nlegal requirements for which parental leave is not considered a \nseparate reason. Getinge is in the process of investigating whether \nthe teams in the US can adopt the global recording and reporting \nrequirements.\nMultiple parental leaves for the same person is counted only \nonce during the period, but as two across reporting periods (e.g. if \nthe person changes from paid to unpaid, etc.).\nGender data is allowing for selecting other categories than \n\u201cMale\u201d or \u201cFemale\u201d.
