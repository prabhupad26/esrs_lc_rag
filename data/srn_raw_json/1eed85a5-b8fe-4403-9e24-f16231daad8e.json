As \na signatory to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), we are \ncommitted to responsible corporate governance and thus the ten \nprinciples of sustainability in the areas of human rights, labor, \nenvironment, and anti-corruption.\nIn 2022, we again published a sustainability report in line with \nthe requirements of the \u201cCore\u201d option of the Global Reporting \nInitiative (GRI). It contains, for the first time, climate-related \ninformation in accordance with the recommendations of the \nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). We \nare thus creating transparency about how we deal with climate-\nrelated risks and opportunities, and we are responding to the \nincreased interest of our stakeholders in climate issues. We have \nalso integrated into the sustainability report a progress report on \nthe implementation of the UNGC principles within the D\u00fcrr Group. \nMoreover, we provide regular information on our actions and \nprogress in the area of sustainability through other channels, for \nexample at investor meetings, on our website, or on social media. \nWe deliver comprehensive data to ESG rating agencies such as \nCDP and EcoVadis, and we were able to improve many of our ESG \nratings in the reporting year.\nWe intensified our efforts in the area of sustainable finance in \n2022 and published a Sustainable Finance Framework for the first \ntime. It provides the framework for future corporate financing \nguided by sustainability principles, and specifies how sustainable \nfinancing instruments, such as green bonds and Schuldschein \nloans, are to be used. Against the backdrop of the German Supply \nChain Due Diligence Act (LkSG), we also pushed ahead with the \nenforcement of high environmental and social standards in our \nglobal supply chain. Another focus was the implementation of our \nclimate strategy.\nNFS\nThe issue of sustainability is a central component of the Group\u2019s\nstrategy. The Sustainability Council, the central decision-making\nbody for sustainability issues in the D\u00fcrr Group, met once in 2022. It\nadopts sustainability strategies and targets and tracks the Group\u2019s\nprogress toward meeting them. In 2022, the group of participants\nwas expanded to include representatives from the three areas of\nDistribution Logistics, Corporate Accounting & Controlling, and\nCorporate Internal Audit & Internal Controls. The CEO of D\u00fcrr AG\nchairs the Sustainability Council and has overall responsibility for\nCorporate Sustainability. \nThe Supervisory Board advises and supports the Board of\nManagement on sustainability issues and appointed one of\nits members, Dr. Anja Schuler, as a sustainability expert.\nThe Sustainability Council invites the sustainability expert to\nits meetings on a case-by-case basis. The members of the\nSupervisory Board and the Sustainability Council attended\na sustainability-specific training seminar in June 2022, thus\nenhancing their relevant competencies. \nMateriality analysis\nIn order to determine which sustainability topics are particularly\nrelevant for the D\u00fcrr Group and its stakeholders, we carried out\na materiality analysis in 2020. The business criticality of various\nnon-financial matters was determined on the basis of discussions\nwith specialized departments, interviews with managers, and\na management workshop. At the same time, we assessed the\neconomic, environmental, and social impacts of our business\nactivities and had them validated by external sustainability\nexperts. In 2021, we further specified our materiality analysis and\nclassified the climate impact of our operations to be material\nfor the D\u00fcrr Group in keeping with Section 289c of the German\nCommercial Code (HGB)."

This \nmeans we had already created the organizational and content-\nrelated prerequisites for the Group-wide implementation of the \ntaxonomy requirements in the previous year. Further discussions \nand analysis were conducted in 2022 to validate our statements. \nAs a result, we have not made any significant changes to \nthe interpretation, the relevant economic activities, and the \nmethodology of data collection compared with the previous year. \nLarge portions of the D\u00fcrr Group\u2019s business activities are still not \ndirectly covered by the taxonomy requirements, as the current \nversion of the EU Taxonomy Regulation is not directly aimed at the \nmechanical engineering sector and the supplier industry. \nBUSINESS ACTIVITIES OF THE D\u00dcRR GROUP  \nOur business activities make a substantial contribution to \nreducing global greenhouse gas emissions in two respects. \nFirstly, we develop and market low-emission technologies for \nsustainable production processes.

This includes, \namong other things, investments in energy-efficient buildings and \ntheir technical equipment, the increased use of systems for the \ngeneration of renewable energies, and the expansion of our electric \nvehicle fleet and charging infrastructure. \nIDENTIFICATION OF TA XONOMY-ELIGIBLE \nECONOMIC ACTIVITIES\nIn order to identify taxonomy-eligible technologies, we have \nfiltered the D\u00fcrr Group\u2019s portfolio for low carbon solutions and \nclassified as taxonomy-eligible those technologies that contribute \nto a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The \nfollowing economic activities defined by the EU Taxonomy have \nbeen identified for the recognition and assignment of sales \nrevenues, CapEx, and OpEx of the D\u00fcrr Group: \n \n\u0216 3.1 Manufacture of renewable energy technologies\n \n\u0216 3.6 Manufacture of other low carbon technologies\n \n\u0216 4.11 Storage of thermal energy\nThe activity description \u201c3.6 Manufacture of other low carbon \ntechnologies\u201d is of particular relevance to the D\u00fcrr Group. Due to \nthe generic description of this economic activity, it is necessary \nto describe our interpretation in greater detail. The economic \nactivity includes activities for the production of technologies that \naim at substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in \nother sectors of the economy. From the D\u00fcrr Group\u2019s perspective, \na substantial reduction means a decrease in greenhouse gas \nemissions in the use phase by at least 20%. Such a substantial \nreduction can usually only be achieved by a technological leap \nand not by continuous improvements. We have therefore set the \nvalue of 20% as the minimum level for a substantial reduction in \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\nFor the 2022 fiscal year, the following business activities of the \nPainting technology\nDespite significant technological leaps in recent years, modern \npaint shops continue to be among the biggest energy consumers in \nthe production of automobiles. In particular, paint application and \ndrying of the car bodies are responsible for the majority of energy \nand resource consumption in paint shops. In addition to machines \nand systems that meet current market standards, we also sell \nsolutions with above-average energy-efficiency and resource-\nsavings that we classify as taxonomy-eligible due to the significant \nsavings of emissions. In the following, only those machines and \nsystems are identified as taxonomy-eligible that contribute to \na significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Examples \ninclude selected solutions for dry separation of paint overspray, \nsuch as EcoDryScrubber or EcoDryX, and our latest EcoProBooth \npaint booth concept. With the help of these technologies, energy \nconsumption during paint application in the paint booth can be \nreduced by up to 60% compared to conventional wet separation. \nIn the field of car body curing, the EcoInCure oven and the \nEcoSmart VEC fresh- and exhaust-air control system can achieve \na reduction in energy consumption of more than 20% compared to \nconventional drying systems. Furthermore, our intelligent energy \nnetwork EcoQPower contributes to a significant reduction in the \nenergy consumption of paint shops through an optimal combined \nheating and cooling system. These solutions are complemented in \nparticular by energy- and resource-saving technologies for paint \napplication, including the EcoPaintJet overspray-free application \nsystem, the EcoBell3 atomizer product line with twin main needle, \nthe EcoLCC color changer generation, and the EcoSupplyP special \npaint supply system. The business activities of the D\u00fcrr Group \nconsidered in painting technology are assigned to economic \nactivity 3.6.\nBattery manufacturing technology\nThe D\u00fcrr Group offers specific technologies for producing \nrechargeable battery packs and accumulators for the \ntransportation sector as well as stationary or decentralized energy \nstorage systems. Only machines and systems for such a purpose \nare covered below. Due to their specific nature, it would not make \neconomic sense for our customers to use these technologies for \nany other purpose, as this would require correspondingly complex \ntechnical adjustments.

To this end, we relied on \ninternal queries, documentation of audits as part of the ISO 14001 \ncertification of relevant sites, and external data sources. From the \nresults, we derived and described possible adaptation solutions.\nThe fourth EU environmental objective, \u201ctransition to a circular \neconomy,\u201d includes general requirements regarding high \ndurability, ease of disassembly, and reparability. The majority of the \ncomponents installed in our machines and systems are designed \nfor a very long service life and still have a monetary material value \nat the end of their useful life. Therefore, they can usually be either \nreused or recycled in a useful manner by an external facility. In \naddition, our Group-wide spare parts and modernization business \nensures an extended service life for the machines and systems \nused by our customers. \nThe criteria for the fifth EU environmental objective, \u201cpollution \nprevention and control,\u201d relate primarily to legal and regulatory \nrequirements with which we are obliged to comply. Compliance \nin the context of our business activities is monitored and ensured \nworldwide by our Group-wide environmental management \nsystem. This includes compliance with the substances listed in \nRegulation (EC) No. 1907/2006 (REACH) and Directive 2011/65/\nEU (RoHS Directive). By contrast, Regulations (EU) 2019/1021 \n(POPs Regulation), (EU) 2017/852 (Mercury Regulation), and (EC) \nNo. 1005/2009 (Ozone Layer Regulation) were not deemed relevant \nto our business activities following internal analyses by experts. \nThe use of substances of concern identified by the EU is regulated \nfor our machines and systems in our purchasing conditions, among \nother things. Corresponding documentation (for example safety \ndata sheets) \u2013 including for purchased components \u2013 is usually \nprovided to our customers upon project completion.

Furthermore, internal \nanalyses have shown that none of the sites considered is located \nin or near biodiversity-sensitive areas.\nAs a result, we have not identified any significant harm to the \nachievement of the five other environmental objectives at any \nrelevant location.  \nCOMPLIANCE WITH MINIMUM SAFEGUARDS  \nThe D\u00fcrr Group is committed to respecting human rights and \npromoting fair working conditions \u2013 this applies in particular to \ndealings with its own employees and direct suppliers. Our actions \nare guided by the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the \nUnited Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights \n(UNGP), and the Core Labor Standards of the International Labour \nOrganization (ILO), among others. In the 2022 fiscal year, we again \nreviewed compliance with these guiding principles and standards \nin our business activities across the Group, focusing on respect for \nhuman and employee rights as well as on combating bribery and \ncorruption.

Depending on the business activity, such service \nrevenues are determined from separately identifiable service \nprojects or on the basis of appropriate allocation keys as a subset \nof total service business. Only taxonomy-eligible or taxonomy-\naligned sales revenues of fully consolidated subsidiaries were \ntaken into account.\nIn the 2022 fiscal year, taxonomy-eligible sales revenues again \ncorresponded to taxonomy-aligned sales revenues.

Our aim is to \navoid any violation of compliance rules in our company.\nResponsibility and organization\nThe central body of our compliance organization is the Corporate \nCompliance Board, whose responsibilities include defining and \nfurther developing the compliance management system. Local \nGroup Company Compliance Managers in the Group companies \nsupport the employees in meeting compliance requirements. \nThe Corporate Compliance Officer coordinates all operational \ncompliance issues at Group level. He is the contact person in the \nevent of potential compliance violations and has been responsible \nsince August 2022 for notifying the Chief Financial Officer and \nthe Corporate Compliance Board of any concrete grounds for \nsuspicion. The board examines the need for further steps on a \ncase-by-case basis. \nGuidelines  \nOur Group-wide Code of Conduct forms the ethical foundation of \nour relationships with employees, customers, business partners, \nand shareholders. It is available in ten languages and is part of our \nmandatory onboarding training for all new employees. The Code \nwas revised and redesigned in 2022. In this context, the topics of \nenvironmental and climate protection as well as compliance in the \nsupply chain were specified and emphasized more strongly. We \naccompanied the introduction of the updated Code of Conduct with \ncommunication measures on the intranet and adapted the online \ncompliance training for our employees accordingly.  \nOur Compliance Management System (CMS) provides a framework \nfor action so that all activities in business operations can be \ncarried out in accordance with legal and internal requirements. \nThe three elements of prevention, early detection, and response \nare core components of the CMS. A Group-wide company directive \non compliance defines responsibilities, communication channels, \nand measures. An anti-corruption company directive for the \nGroup also provides our employees with rules of conduct for their \ndealings with business partners and in the event of conflicts of \ninterest. The risk of corruption is also addressed by regulations \nsuch as the separation of functions, approval procedures, and the \nfour-eyes principle. The selection and commissioning of business \npartners for sales-related services and the handling of donations \nare further compliance-relevant topics that are regulated in Group-\nwide company directives. \nProcesses and measures\nEmployees, business partners, and third parties who suspect \nlegal violations, for example corruption or money laundering, or \nviolations of the D\u00fcrr Group\u2019s Code of Conduct, can contact us \nthrough various channels \u2013 anonymously, if they wish.

The average age of our employees is 42. \nAcross the Group, 32% of employees are under 35 years of age; \nthe proportion of this age group is particularly high in China, at \n40%. Germany has the oldest workforce with an average age of \n44 years. 45% of our employees have a university degree, while \n50% have chosen non-academic vocational training. Most of our \nemployees \u2013 namely 26% \u2013 work in assembly and manufacturing. \nMore than 3,000 (16%) are employed in service worldwide. 10% \nof our employees take care of administrative tasks and our \nIT infrastructure. Further personnel figures can be found in  \n table 2.20.\nEMPLOYEE SATISFACTION AND RETENTION\nSatisfied and motivated employees are an important basis of our \ncompany\u2019s success. We therefore assess the satisfaction of our \nemployees and implement improvement measures if required.\nResponsibility and organization \nThe central Corporate Human Resources department is \nresponsible for the Group-wide recording of employee satisfaction \nlevels. Employees\u2019 needs are discussed at the individual Group \nsites between senior management, HR departments, employee \nrepresentatives, and the respective employees.\nProcesses and measures \nWe usually measure the satisfaction of our employees every \nthree years with the help of global surveys. If strikingly negative \nresults occur in certain organizational units, we use them to \nderive improvement measures and review the implementation and \nsuccess of the measures through follow-up surveys. \nThe most recent survey of our employees was conducted in 2019. \nA new survey was planned as per regular schedule for September \n2022. However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, we were not able \nto ensure at that time that all employees worldwide would, in fact, \nbe included in the same way. This affected our employees in China, \namong others. In addition, the significance and comparability of \nthe results would have been limited if a survey had been conducted \nunder the given circumstances, which is why the survey was \npostponed until September 2023. We normally conduct random \npulse surveys on focus topics at least once a year, usually \naddressing issues from the global employee survey. Since this \nsurvey could not take place in 2022, we did not conduct any pulse \nsurveys either.\nWe promote the satisfaction and retention of our employees \nthrough performance-related remuneration, further training \nand career opportunities, flexible working time models, and the \npossibility of mobile working, as well as through offers in the areas \nof work-life balance, sports, health, and culture. The majority of \nour German Group companies is covered by collective agreements. \nIn 2022, collective bargaining was additionally introduced at five \nGerman production companies of HOMAG; negotiations for further \nHOMAG production companies are ongoing.\nWe are convinced that job satisfaction and loyalty depend to \na large extent on a company\u2019s values and goals, as well as on \nits contribution to society and its purpose. In 2022, we took a \nclose look at this and developed a new corporate statement for \nthe D\u00fcrr Group as part of the OneVision project. With strong \nemployee participation \u2013 over 800 employees had their say \u2013 we \ndeveloped a new set of values and forward-looking statements \nfor mission, vision, and purpose. The focus is on concepts such \nas sustainability, efficiency, and technology leadership, but also \ncourage, responsibility, respect, collaboration, and curiosity. As \npart of a change process, we want to familiarize the workforce with \nthe vision, mission, purpose, and values in 2023 and establish the \nnew corporate statement as a guideline for future action. \nIn October 2022, a uniform ideas management system was \nintroduced under the name of \u201cSpark,\u201d enabling employees of all \nGerman sites to enter suggestions for improvement via an online \nplatform. As of December 31, 2022, 649 ideas had already been \nsubmitted. The platform stimulates exchange across departments \nand locations, creating more transparency. At the same time, the \nopportunity for employees to participate is intended to strengthen \ntheir identification with the Company. In the future, \u201cSpark\u201d is to \nbe made available worldwide. \nNFS\nNFS"

A company directive \ngoverns cooperation between Corporate Human Resources, \nthe HR departments of the three subgroups, and the local \nHR managers. As part of Corporate Human Resources, the \nCorporate People Development department is responsible for the \nGroup-wide management and coordination of people development \nand further training. \nGuidelines, processes, and measures \nStructures and processes of people development are regulated \nby a company directive. The software-supported personnel \ndevelopment process \u201cPeople Development\u201d helps us identify \nand develop potential managers within the Company and make the \nbest possible use of young talent. At annual people development \nconferences on various levels of the Group, staff responsible \nfor people development and managers communicate about the \nadvancement of high-potential employees and about succession \nplanning. \nIn 2022, we developed new processes for performance and talent \nmanagement in Group-wide subprojects that will be used in the \nfuture. We also developed and adopted a new skills model for \nmanagers and employees, in which we describe cross-disciplinary \nskills that are required to optimally support our Group strategy, for \nexample innovative strength and communication. \nAs a Group-wide platform for further training, the D\u00fcrr Group \nAcademy (DGA) pools all further training offers and is available \nin 12 languages. Internally organized training programs on topics \nsuch as leadership, working methods, collaboration, as well as \nIT and digitalization can be accessed online by most employees. \nMost of our further training events in 2022 took place virtually. We \nregistered approximately 73,000 online attendances (previous year: \njust under 42,000). The increase is mainly due to the approximately \n28,000 participants in the mandatory online safety training due in the \nyear under review, as well as the need to catch up on qualifications \nfollowing coronavirus-related cancellations in previous years. Most \nof the training courses that promote communication, the exchange \nof experience, and team development were held as in-person \nevents. With over 6,000 participants worldwide, the attendance at \nin-person training sessions increased again significantly (previous \nyear: over 3,500). Overall, the participation rate was 4.3 training \nsessions per employee (previous year: 2.5). As in the previous year, \nspecialized training events accounted for almost one-third of all \nattendances.\nWe have expanded the use of digital learning formats. All \nemployees have access to numerous online courses at any time \nvia the LinkedIn Learning platform. As of December 31, 2022, 8,558 \nemployees were registered there. Learning time spent on LinkedIn \nLearning totaled 10,492 hours. In 2022, the Digital Training Days \nweek was hosted again. In short online courses, around 4,400 \nemployees found out how to use collaborative Office applications \nin their daily work routines. We also promote collaboration, \nnetworking, and knowledge sharing through the Working Out Loud \n(WOL) project, which was continued in 2022. \nWe have expanded our international corporate training events. \n1,806 employees (previous year: 1,188) attended best-practice \ntraining courses on project management, sales, and leadership \nas well as qualification programs for prospective and experienced \nmanagers. The Fit for Leadership Program combines international \nonline sessions with local in-person events. In 2022, 221 future \nexecutives attended (previous year: 179). The Advanced Leadership \nProgram was used by 68 experienced managers (previous year: 41). \nIn the Leadership Project Management Program, 89 project \nNFS\nNFS"

The certification of all major companies of \nthe D\u00fcrr Systems and Schenck subgroups according to ISO 45001 \nis to be completed by 2024. \nEnvironment and climate \nprotection\nOur overarching objective is to reduce environmental and climate \nimpacts associated with our business activities. This relates not \nonly to the production sites, but also to the entire value chain, \nwhose individual segments have varying degrees of impact on \nour environmental footprint. To improve our environmental and \nclimate balance, we aim to continuously reduce the consumption of \nmaterials, resources, and energy, the volume of waste generated, \nand greenhouse gas emissions in relation to sales. \nIn 2022, our focus was on implementing the Group-wide climate \nstrategy with which we aim to contribute to the 1.5\u00b0C target of \nthe Paris Climate Agreement. Our climate targets have been \nscientifically validated by the Science Based Targets initiative \n(SBTi). We have implemented measures to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions at numerous sites in Germany and abroad, for example \nthe installation of photovoltaic systems, the conversion to green \nelectricity, and the expansion of the charging infrastructure for \nbattery-powered vehicles.\nfor environmental issues lies with the management of our local \ncompanies, which are subject to site-specific environmental \naction plans.\nIn October 2022, an international meeting of all the Group\u2019s \nenvironmental managers was held for the first time.

We have set ourselves the goal of obtaining \ncertification for the environmental management systems of \nall locations with production or assembly facilities or with a \ntechnical center and where hazardous substances are regularly \nhandled. These certifications are based on the environmental \nmanagement standard ISO 14001. Almost 60% of the relevant \nlocations are already certified according to this standard. Our \nGerman sites regularly conduct energy audits or have a certified \nenergy management system according to ISO 50001. An overview \nof certifications held can be found at www.durr-group.com under \nSustainability/Documents, Ratings, Certificates.\n2.27 \u2014 CERTIFICATION\n2022 \n2021\n2020\nSites with environmental \nmanagement certified to ISO 140011\n28\n21\n18\nSites with energy management \ncertified to ISO 500011 or similar\n19\n112\n112\n1 Sites used by several companies of the D\u00fcrr Group sometimes hold multiple certificates. \n2 Only sites with an energy management system according to ISO 50001 were considered.\nThe starting point for our climate protection activities is the \nGroup-wide climate strategy. In order to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions in our own operations (Scope 1 and Scope 2) and in \nthe upstream and downstream value chain (Scope 3), we take \nmeasures in six areas: energy, awareness, mobility, logistics, \nprocurement, and products. In the following, we describe our \nprogress in the individual areas.\nENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT OF OUR PRODUCTS\nWe aim to reduce the environmental impact and climate effects \ncaused by the use of our products. The \u201cEU Taxonomy\u201d \n page 42  \nsection describes the extent to which our business activities \ncontribute to achieving the EU\u2019s environmental objectives.\nOur climate strategy includes the target of reducing emissions \nfrom the downstream value chain (Scope 3) by at least 15% by \n2030 compared to the 2019 base-year level. This depends to a \nlarge extent on the willingness of customers to use the resource- \nconserving, energy-efficient, and low-emission technologies we \noffer. In addition, emissions from our machines and systems can \nbe reduced considerably if green electricity is used for operation \ninstead of gas and conventional electricity. Therefore, the electri-\nfication of our products is one focus of our R&D agenda. \nAccording to our greenhouse gas balance, our products\u2019 use phase \nemissions represent by far the largest share of our total emissions \n(Scope 3.11). Our greatest leverage for reducing emissions thus \nlies in optimizing the energy consumption of our machines and \nsystems. We will publish detailed information on our Scope 3 \nemissions in the Sustainability Report, which will be released in \nmid-2023. \nENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT IN \nTHE SUPPLY CHAIN \nClimate aspects in the supply chain are a central issue for us. Even \nthough the share of our greenhouse gas emissions attributable \nto the supply chain (upstream value chain) is lower than the \nshare attributable to the use phase of our machines and systems \n(downstream value chain), the supply chain is still important for \nreducing emissions. We have therefore set ourselves the target \nof reducing emissions from the upstream value chain (Scope 3) \nby at least 15% by 2030 compared to the 2019 base-year level. We \nare working on a Group-wide concept to take the environmental \nimpact of our suppliers into account in our purchasing \nprocesses. For our high-risk suppliers, we use self-assessment \nquestionnaires throughout the Group that include, among other \nthings, information on environmental management certification. \nFurthermore, all suppliers of the D\u00fcrr Group are contractually \nobliged to comply with environmental laws and standards, based \non our Supplier Code of Conduct. In addition, potential high-risk \nsuppliers have been required to complete an e-learning module \non the topic of sustainability since 2022. Among other things, it \nprovides information on the D\u00fcrr Group\u2019s climate strategy and our \nexpectations from business partners regarding compliance with \nenvironmental and climate protection standards. From 2023, the \nconcept is to be complemented by a program that offers financial \nincentives for business partners using climate-friendly processes. \nIn logistics, we are planning measures to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions from 2023. For example, we want to avoid transport by \nair freight wherever possible and choose low-emission means of \ntransport in the future. The carbon footprint of logistics partners \nwill also play a role when awarding future contracts. \nNFS\nNFS"

An overview \nis available at www.durr-group.com under Investors/Corporate \nGovernance.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the members of the Supervisory Board \nheld 0.12% of D\u00fcrr AG\u2019s shares and the members of the Board of \nManagement held 0.06% of the shares.\nWOMEN IN EXECUTIVE POSITIONS: TARGETS \nAND TARGET IMPLEMENTATION\n \n\u0216 The Board of Management\u2019s resolution adopted on June 2, 2022\nsets out that, going forward, one woman is to be part of the first\nsenior management level below the Board of Management, and\ntwo women are to be part of the second level. The deadline\nfor achieving these targets is June 30, 2027. As of December\n31, 2022, there were no women at these first or second senior\nmanagement levels. The previous resolution adopted by the\nBoard of Management in 2017 had set the targets for the\nproportion of women in senior management positions at 0%\nfor the first level and 20% for the second level below the Board\nof Management. The deadline for achieving those targets was\nJune 30, 2022. At that time, the first senior management leve\nbelow the Board of Management consisted of ten men and no\nwomen, while the second level comprised eight men and one\nwoman. When considering our target achievement, account\nmust be taken of the fact that D\u00fcrr AG, being a management\nholding company, has a relatively small number of employees\nand senior managers. Consequently, a single personnel\nchange can be equivalent to a change of over 10 percentage\npoints. Going forward, when selecting candidates for senior\nmanagement positions, we will focus more keenly on the\ntargeted appointment of women in order to achieve our goals.\n UNAUDITED\n UNAUDITED"

We benefited from this long term focus \nof our customers in 2022. As a result, we raised our order intake \nforecast (originally \u20ac4,100 to \u20ac4,400 million) twice: once in August \nto between \u20ac4,400 and \u20ac4,700 million and again in November to \nbetween \u20ac4,800 and \u20ac5,100 million. \nAs expected, sales increased from quarter to quarter and, at \n\u20ac4,314.1 million, slightly exceeded the target corridor defined in \nFebruary (\u20ac3,900 to \u20ac4,200 million). This marked a strong 22.0% \ngain over the previous year, on which the pandemic had taken its \ntoll. Overall, we are very satisfied with our sales performance: \nAfter a subdued start to the year, we were able to adapt more \nand more efficiently to the disruptions along the supply chains; in \nthe second half of the year, we successfully harnessed the effects \nof the nascent improvement in material sourcing to generate \nhigher sales. \nThe net extraordinary expenses included in EBIT amounted to \n\u20ac26.3 million and therefore matched the forecast of approximately \n\u20ac25 million. As expected, the bulk of the extraordinary \nexpenses was attributable to purchase price allocation effects \n(\u20ac\u201323.9 million). In addition, expenses of \u20ac7.0 million arose in the \nfourth quarter for restructuring and the impairment of assets at \nour Russian companies. \nAt \u20ac134.3 million, earnings after tax reached the target corridor \ndefined in May, rising by 58.1% over the previous year. They were \nparticularly underpinned by a significant improvement in financial \nresult. In the previous year, the financial result had included \nnon-recurring expenses arising from the renewal of the pool \nagreement with the Schuler/Klessmann shareholder group, which \nholds 14.05% of the shares in HOMAG Group AG.\nAt 17.3%, the ROCE \n page 263 was above the previous year\u2019s figure \n(15.5%) and reached the upper end of the target range, which \nwe had lowered to between 13% and 18% in May. The reduction \nin this target was due to our revised EBIT forecast; despite the \nsignificantly higher sales, there was only a moderate increase \nof 5.0% in capital employed \n page 263. The net working capital \nincluded in this dropped slightly (by 2.8%) despite the higher sales \nand inventories, as we received extensive prepayments as a result"

A good half of this increase was attributable to the high-\ngrowth Woodworking Machinery and Systems division. Annual \naverage employee numbers were 5.8% up on the previous year. At \nthe same time, personnel expense increased by 12.5% as a result \nof acquisition effects as well as higher fixed and performance-\nrelated remuneration. In addition, it should be borne in mind that, \nas a result of the pandemic, we were still making greater use \nof short-time work and similar cost-cutting instruments in the \nprevious year. At \u20ac68,154 in 2021, personnel expense per employee \nwas thus below the pre-pandemic figure of \u20ac69,055 recorded in \n2019.

In addition, there are risks \nin China stemming from the possibility of further lockdowns and a \nrecession due to the real estate bubble and rising unemployment. \nMoreover, there is an increased risk that consumer demand in our \ncustomers\u2019 end markets, for example in the furniture sector, will \nbe weaker than expected due to inflation and rising interest rates.\nIn general, there is still a risk of contract awards or projects \nbeing delayed, for instance because start-up customers postpone \nplanned investments due to a lack of or delays in financing. The \nlower volume of demand in 2020 had a temporary negative impact \non sales and margins in 2021. There is a general risk that demand \nwill not develop as expected and the competitive situation will \ndeteriorate, with a corresponding negative impact on incoming \norders, sales, and margins. However, there are also opportunities \narising from start-ups in the field of electromobility, the increasing \nlocalization of automotive production in the wake of trade conflicts, \nand the trend in the automotive industry to switch production to \nmore resource-efficient processes. The relevant information is \ncontained in the \u201cOpportunities\u201d \n page 114 chapter. \nIn the automotive business, there is a risk of customers enforcing \npayment terms that are unfavorable to us. The willingness to make \nhigher prepayments for major projects may vary, depending on our \ncustomers\u2019 access to liquidity. Due to the high order intake, cash \ninflow from prepayments was recently at a good level. Chinese \ncustomers in particular prefer bank acceptance drafts \u2013 a kind of \nbill of exchange \u2013 to conventional prepayments. In corresponding \nprojects, payments from customers also tend to be made later \nor less evenly over the duration of the project. Payment defaults \nhave not increased significantly; uncollectible claims are rare in \nparticular in business with the automotive industry. \nFor projects with new producers of electric vehicles, we prevent \ncredit rating risks by conducting a thorough solvency check in \nadvance. If the creditworthiness falls below a threshold value \ndefined by us, we monitor receivables closely or do not accept \norders at all. In the execution of our projects, we make sure that \nthere is a positive balance of cash inflows and outflows.

The Board of \nManagement and the Corporate Development central function are \nesponsible for this at the level of D\u00fcrr AG. If opportunities are found \no be of major strategic significance, we form multidisciplinary \neams to conduct potential analyses and establish the budget.\noint activities with universities, research institutes, and the D\u00fcrr \nTechnology Council also form part of opportunity management. \nThese contacts help us to determine the extent to which new \ncientific findings may yield opportunities for the D\u00fcrr Group. \nOpportunities may also arise from new legislation, e.g. on emission \nprotection and international trade. Our opportunity management \nystem takes account of global and regional business opportunities \ns well as the potential offered by specific products, customers, \nnd business models."

As in 2021 and 2022, we \nhave budgeted a free cash flow of \u20ac50 to \u20ac100 million. Given the \nexpected cash flow, low net debt, and the good liquidity situation \nin 2022, we have sufficient financial flexibility to cover operational \nfunding requirements, the financial resources required for \nacquisitions, and the proposed dividend payout."

The unplanned extraordinary effects arose from non-\noperating items in connection with restructuring in Russia, the \nreversal of restructuring provisions in the Woodworking Machinery \nand Systems division, personnel expenses from acquisitions at \nvarious Group companies, and the impairment recognized on \nthe iTAC Software AG brand name. Free cash flow amounted to \n\u20ac117.1 million in 2022. The ESG target for 2022 consisted of four \nsub-targets, each of which had a weighting of 25%. One of the four \nsub-targets was oriented to the EcoVadis ESG rating, while the \nother three were related to environmental, social, and governance \naspects. The EcoVadis rating shows an increase to 72 points (gold \nstatus) for 2022, compared to 66 points in the previous year. The \nclimate strategy (environmental) sub-target indicated a reduction \nof 28,921 tons or 51% in Scope 1 and 2 CO2e emissions in 2022. \nThe third sub-target (social) was to be assessed on the basis of \nthe results of an employee survey. However, this employee survey \nwas postponed until September 2023, as it was not possible to \nensure that all employees worldwide were able to participate in \nthe same way at the planned time due to the Covid-19 pandemic. \nAs a result, this sub-target was assigned 0% target achievement. \nThe fourth sub-target (governance) related to sustainable supply \nchains. In this respect, 80% of the high-risk suppliers active in \n2022 signed the D\u00fcrr Group\u2019s Supplier Code of Conduct, and 60% \nof the high-risk suppliers active in 2022 carried out a supplier self \nassessment. Total achievement of the four ESG sub-targets came \nto 112.5% in 2022."

This sales \nrevenue is recognized at the date on which the customer obtains \ncontrol over the promised asset. This is usually the point in time \nwhen the machine is delivered to the customer, at which point \nthe customer obtains legal title to the machine or has inspected \nit. Services provided are recognized at the time rendered as \nsales revenue recognized over time. For standard machines and \nspare parts, the customer makes the payment upon receiving the \ninvoice, which is done following delivery or acceptance, depending \non the contractual arrangements. Progress payments are also \ndemanded from the customer.\nPerformance obligations\nThe Group divides its contracts with customers into performance \nobligations, separating them based on contractual terms into \nperformance obligations that are either satisfied at a point in \ntime or over time. The customer contracts are analysed for \nseparable performance obligations. In addition to the performance \nobligation to produce a machine or plant for the customer, \nseparable performance obligations in the Paint and Final \nAssembly Systems, Application Technology and Clean Technology \nSystems divisions mainly include spare parts packages and \npartial modifications. In the Measuring and Process Systems and \nWoodworking Machinery and Systems divisions, it is primarily \nthe assembly and commissioning that play a role as separable \nperformance obligations. \nIntangible assets\nIntangible assets comprise goodwill, franchises, brand names, \nIntangible assets are recognized at cost. Intangible assets with \na finite useful life are amortized over their useful life using the \nstraight-line method, unless they are impaired. Goodwill and other \nintangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized. \nOther intangible assets are tested once annually to determine \nwhether events and circumstances still justify the assumption \nthat they have an indefinite useful life. If this is not the case, \nthe estimated useful life is changed on a prospective basis from \nindefinite to finite in accordance with the requirements of IAS 8 \n\u201cAccounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and \nErrors\u201d. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are likewise \ntested once a year or sooner if there are any indications that an \nasset may be impaired. In addition to goodwill, the D\u00fcrr Group \nrecognizes brand names as further intangible assets with mostly \nindefinite useful lives. These brand names are generally tested \nannually for impairment alongside goodwill. Like goodwill, the \nbrand names are part of the net assets of a cash-generating unit. \nThe recoverability of the HOMAG China and iTAC brands is tested \nseparately each year.\nIn the Group development costs are only recognized as internally \ngenerated intangible assets if the conditions set forth in IAS 38 are \nsatisfied. These include the following criteria: \n \n\u0216 Technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that \nit will be available for use or sale\n \n\u0216 The probability of a future economic benefit arising from the \nuse of the asset\n The ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to"

The D\u00fcrr Group does not currently \nmake use of the option to measure financial assets at fair value \nthrough profit or loss at initial recognition.\nLoss allowances and impairment of financial assets \nThe D\u00fcrr Group uses an impairment model based on the expected \ncredit loss model, which is applicable for all financial assets \n(debt instruments) that are measured at amortized cost or at fair \nvalue through other comprehensive income. The expected credit \nloss model distinguishes between the general approach and the \nsimplified approach. The general approach allocates the financial \nassets to three risk stages and is mainly applicable for cash and \ncash equivalents as well as sundry financial assets. For contract \nassets, trade receivables and lease receivables, the simplified \nmodel is applied and thus the first of the three risk levels is not \nconsidered.\nIf there has been a significant increase in the credit risk since \ninitial recognition, the assets are allocated to stage 2. A number \nof qualitative and quantitative criteria are used to assess whether \nthe credit risk has increased significantly since a financial asset \nwas recognized for the first time. This involves, for example, \nexamining whether the total comprehensive income of the debtor \nhas deteriorated significantly or whether it is expected to do \nso. Financial assets are allocated to stage 2 at the latest when \ncontractual payment is more than 30 days past due.\nFinancial assets are allocated to stage 3 or their default is \nassumed if circumstances occur that could impair the ability of a \ncertain debtor to meet their financial obligations. For all financial \nassets, this means observing the criteria of being 90 days past due \nas well as using qualitative credit ratings for debtors. For example, \nthe likelihood of insolvency or any other financial reorganization of \nthe debtor results in the financial assets being allocated to stage 3. \nIn deviation from the past due criteria mentioned above, trade \nreceivables and contract assets which are measured in accordance \nwith the simplified approach are allocated to stage 3 when more \nthan twelve months past due. This appropriately reflects the \nindustry-specific experience and payment patterns for long-term \nprojects in the plant and machinery construction sector. \nFinancial assets are derecognized as soon as reasonable \ninformation is available that indicates that they are uncollectible, \nsuch as insolvency proceedings coming to an end or following"

The present \nvalue of the exercise amount is determined at the end of each \nreporting period. This requires an estimate of future earnings to \nbe made. The options of the entities acquired in the 2021 reporting \nperiod contain personnel expense components that are earned pro \nrata over the period until the options are exercised. Please refer to \n notes 12 and 18 for further details.\nShare-based payment\nThe measurement of cash-settled share-based payment \ntransactions is based on the anticipated share price at the end of \nthe contractual term and earnings ratios over the duration of the \nprogram. Historical share prices are used to determine the fair \nvalue. The earnings ratios used are based on internal forecasts. \nThe actual share prices and earnings ratios may deviate from the \nassumptions made. \nEstimates and assumptions are also required for the recognition \nin sales revenue and incoming orders, so that the direct effects \nof the Ukraine war on the business as well as assets, liabilities, \nfinancial position and financial performance of the Group have \nbeen minor so far.

The \ncontribution of the Ukrainian business, which has been suspended \ndue to the war, to revenue and incoming orders, is also negligible, \nwith less than 1%. The sanctions against Russia led to impairment \nand restructuring requirements in the Russian group companies. \nPlease refer to \n notes 18 and 29 for details on the impairment and \nrestructuring requirements.\nMore significant than the direct effects were the indirect effects \nof the Ukraine war on energy prices as well as the market and \nprocurement environment, which in many cases was characterized \nby high and rising material prices and material shortages. The \nadverse effects led to unplanned additional expenses.\nCoronavirus pandemic\nIn most countries, the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the \nbusiness performance as well as on the assets, liabilities, financial \nposition and financial performance continued to decrease and \nresulted in significantly lower strains. China is an exception: The \nlockdowns imposed there significantly impacted sales revenue and \nearnings in the second quarter.

Under these plans, \nemployees of the D\u00fcrr Group are entitled to convert certain parts \nof their future pay into an entitlement to future supplementary \ncompany benefits. To secure and finance the resulting obligations, \nthe Group has taken out employer\u2019s pension liability insurance for \nthe life of the beneficiaries or invests to a small extent in balanced \nfunds comprising shares and bonds. The D\u00fcrr Group has the \nexclusive right to the respective benefits. This therefore does not \nrepresent any significant actuarial risk or investment risk for the \nD\u00fcrr Group. The amount of post-employment benefits equals the \nbenefit paid out under the employer\u2019s pension liability insurance \nconcluded by the company, which consists of a guaranteed pension \nand the divisible surplus allocated by the insurance company. For \nthe fund investment, the benefits paid out later correspond to the \nbalance of the fund. The D\u00fcrr Group reports the benefit obligations \nnet of assets.\nstake in a US-wide pension plan. The defined benefit plans are \naccounted for as defined contribution plans as it is not possible to \nallocate the share of obligations and plan assets to the individual \nmember companies. The risks from the two multi-employer plans \ndiffer from plans tailored to a specific company with regard to jointly \nmanaged pension assets, which can potentially also be used to \ncover obligations of other participating employers. If participating \nplan sponsors discontinue current contribution payments, the \nremaining plan sponsors collectively take over the unfunded \nfunding deficit; withdrawing from the plan is, however, regularly \nsubject to a withdrawal fee to limit the risk for the remaining \nplan sponsors. The beneficiaries of the plans are members of a \ntrade union. The contributions are calculated on the basis of the \nnumber of production hours worked by members. A temporary \nshortfall in capacity utilization as well as lower returns on plan \nassets meant there have been deficits in the past. There has no \nlonger been a deficit in the local pension plan since March 31, \n2018. In the US-wide pension plan, the total deficit amounted to \naround \u20ac 1,456,054 thousand as of January 1, 2022 (prior period: \n\u20ac 1,781,847 thousand). The D\u00fcrr Group has a roughly 0.2% stake \nin this US-wide plan. For the following year, the Group expects \ncontributions of \u20ac 3,203 thousand (prior period: \u20ac 2,968 thousand) \nto be made to the pension plans."

Around 65% (prior period: 70%) of the contract-\nrelated provisions relate to provisions for warranties and onerous \ncontracts in the order backlog. The calculation of the contract-\nrelated provisions is largely based on expected losses from \npending delivery and service transactions, mainly due to the \nincrease in material prices and transport costs, as well as on \nstatutory or contractual warranty claims and was performed using \npast experience and taking current circumstances into account."

This \nrelates to contracts for which customer payments received or due \nexceed the project status. Regular progress payments are typically \nagreed in the mechanical and plant engineering sector based on \nthe progress of the project. In most cases a customer payment is \nalready due before work commences. This results in the customer \nhaving to prefinance the project in the ordinary course of business. \nDuring the project, further payments are invoiced based on \nproject milestones reached. In the 2022 reporting period, there \nwere no notable deviations from this typical relationship between \nperformance and customer payment. This is reflected in the \ndisclosure of the balance as a contract liability."

Consequently, their carrying \namounts at the end of the reporting period approximate their fair \nvalue.\nThe fair value of non-current liabilities is based on the current \ninterest rate for borrowing at similar terms and conditions with \ncomparable due date and credit rating. With the exception of the \nconvertible bond, Schuldschein loans, liabilities to banks and \nobligations from options, the fair value of liabilities approximates \nthe carrying amount. \nThe fair value of the convertible bond (fair value hierarchy level 1) \nis calculated by multiplying the nominal value with the quoted \nprice at the end of the reporting period. As of the reporting date, \nthe convertible bond was listed at 108.26% (prior period: 134.38%), \nwhich is equal to a market value of \u20ac 162,390 thousand (prior \nperiod: \u20ac 201,570 thousand). \nThe fair value of the Schuldschein loans as well as liabilities to \nbanks (fair value hierarchy level 2) is determined by discounting \nthe cash flows as of the measurement date with discount rates \nwith matching terms.  \nThe obligations from options measured at amortized cost (level 3 \nin the fair value hierarchy) primarily relate to the sundry financial \nliabilities recognized under the domination and profit and loss \ntransfer agreement with HOMAG Group AG for the acquisition \nof shares as well as to settle the compensation entitlements. \nThe sundry financial liabilities are recognized through profit \nor loss in the subsequent measurement. The expected term of \nthe arbitration proceedings as well as the expected amount of \nthe compensation payment and cash settlement determine the \nmeasurement of the option. Due to an initial ruling of the Stuttgart \nRegional Court, which is not yet legally binding, the expected \ncompensation payment was raised from \u20ac 1.01 to \u20ac 1.03 (net) and \nthe expected cash settlement from \u20ac 31.56 to \u20ac 31.58. On account \nof the new pool agreement concluded with the shareholder group \nSchuler/Klessmann in the 2021 reporting period and the initial \nruling of the Stuttgart Regional Court, the price of the shares \nwas increased from \u20ac 25.00 to the expected exercise price of \n\u20ac 31.58 in the 2021 reporting period and the term assumed for \nthe measurement was adjusted, causing the liability to increase \naccordingly. Compared to expectations in the prior period, the \nterm of the arbitration proceedings was extended by one year. \nThe fair value is determined using a net present value model \nbased on the cash settlement including compensation payment \nas well as the legal minimum interest rate and a discount rate \nwith a matching term. The difference between the fair value and \nthe carrying amount is due to the fact that the fair value takes into \naccount changes in the actual interest rate environment, while the \ndiscount rate used for measurement at amortized cost remains \nmostly unchanged over the term."
