The latter had begun to emerge in the \nwake of the pandemic and was exacerbated by the \ninvasion of Ukraine. Our hope is that these issues, \nwhilst creating unwelcome uncertainty in the \nshort-term, have focused world leaders on the need \nto secure reliable and diverse sources of energy, \nwithout overdependence on a single source. \nAs a result of this focus, in the longer term, we are \nexpecting to witness investments in renewable energy \nsupplies speed up, as a more secure and cost-effective \ntype of energy source for many countries. \nof the economy will be key to success. This year, \nwe have witnessed regulatory bodies from around \nthe globe increase their focus on sustainability issues, \nespecially climate and biodiversity. As a company \nwe have supported the efforts for global harmonisation \non sustainability standards, most prominently through \nengagement on consultations, including those \nof the ISSB and the UK\u2019s Transition Plan Taskforce \n(TPT), as well as being an active member of industry \nbodies, such as the Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance \n(NZAOA) and Net Zero Asset Managers initiative \n(NZAMi).

For many \nyears, our investment management division has been \nproactively engaging with policymakers, advocating \nfor an ambitious, effective and robust global regulatory \nand legislative environment that will help accelerate \nprogress against complex sustainability commitments \nand challenges that the world faces. \nCollaborating with like-minded investors and stakeholders \nallows us to raise and share concerns about specific \nresponsible investment topics, approaches and \ncompanies, with other investors. These forums allow \nus to share resources and enable us to monitor and \ninfluence a broad range of global systemic ESG risks \nand opportunities. They helps us strengthen our voice \non important topics around the world, and to broaden \nour global reach. By being part of supportive networks, \nwe hope to encourage greater investor involvement \nin ESG-related initiatives. \nOur climate collaborations include:\n\u2022 Aldersgate Group.\n\u2022 Bank of England Climate Risk forum.\n\u2022 Better Building Partnership.\n\u2022 Climate Action 100+.\n\u2022 Energy Transitions Commission.\n\u2022 FAIRR.\n\u2022 Get Nature Positive.\n\u2022 Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero \n(GFANZ).\n\u2022 Institutional Investors Group on Climate \nChange.\n\u2022 NZAMi.\n\u2022 NZAOA.\n\u2022 One Planet Asset Managers.\n\u2022 Powering Past Coal Alliance.\n\u2022 Principles for Responsible Investment.\n\u2022 Science Based Targets initiative.\n\u2022 Sustainable Markets Initiative.\n\u2022 Transition Plan Taskforce.\n\u2022 UK Green Building Council."

This covers both transition \nand physical impacts of the scenario \n2.   using asset valuation models to convert these \ncompany financial impacts into corporate \nsecurity impacts (i.e. equity and bond valuations \nand bond ratings) \n3.  using our sovereign bond valuation model to \nconvert corresponding country-level scenarios into \nsovereign bond valuations. \nScenario results are produced for the three pathways \nwhich are based on transition risks (Below 2\u00b0C, Net \nBond downgrade analysis\nGiven the importance of bonds within our portfolio, we \nfirst consider the impacts of climate risks on the credit \nquality and sector breakdown of our portfolio. \nWe are primarily a long-dated \u2018buy-and-hold\u2019 bond \ninvestor, managing our portfolio to match our short- \nand long-term payments to retirement customers. \nOur balance sheet and cashflow matching is therefore \nmore impacted by bond downgrades and defaults than \nmovements in bond value. \nThe opening credit rating exposure of our bond \nportfolio is shown in Chart 5, showing that 99% of the \nportfolio is investment grade (rated BBB and above). Of \nthis, BBB-rated bonds, which carry the greatest credit \ntransition risk, comprise 36% of the portfolio, and of \nthose, the ones from the high carbon sectors (defined \nas energy, utilities, materials and industrials) only \nWhile our holdings are in bespoke bond portfolios, \ngiving us more freedom in sector selection, we have \nexposure to most sectors in the investment universe to \nmaintain a well-diversified portfolio, with the modelled \nbreakdown given in Chart 6. \nFor this analysis, we have directly modelled c.\u00a320 \nbillion (28%) of the group\u2019s \u00a370.7 billion of proprietary \nbond assets, on a line-by-line basis as of 31 December \n2022. To increase coverage, we have scaled these \nimpacts across the rest of the bond portfolio, \naccounting for differing credit rating profiles.\n \nThe cumulative amount downgraded to sub-\ninvestment grade (assuming no active trading), which \nwould have negative implications for our balance \nsheet, is shown in Chart 7.

The \nDelayed Below 2\u00b0C scenario also creates notable \nmacro GDP impacts, leading to greater impacts across \nall sectors. These results show the broad sector \nimpacts, but within each sector there can be a large \nrange of impacts with winners and losers over \ndifferent time periods. This includes, for example, \nsome utility companies that do not survive in the \nBelow 2\u00b0C scenario while others experience near \nzero risk. \nWe note that any impacts to 2050 are beyond the \nduration of most of our current portfolio. Future \ninvestments will be influenced by climate change \ntrends, and we would therefore expect to materially \nchange our allocation away from the names most \nmaterially impacted under each scenario."

            "text": "Materiality assessment\nOur risk management approach to the financial \nrisks arising from climate change reflects our climate \nstrategy, the materiality of the exposures and how we \noperate. When assessing materiality, we consider both \nhow the group is affected by climate change, as well \nas the group\u2019s own impact on the climate.\nThe effect of future uncertainty over climate change \npathways is that the evaluation of climate-related risks \nand impacts has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, \nwith a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater \nthan our materiality for the group\u2019s financial statements \nas a whole, and possibly many times that amount.\nOur scenario modelling enables us to assess how the \nimpacts from climate change may emerge under a \nrange of climate scenarios and time horizons. Given \nour business model, we assess the most material \nfinancial risks from the potential impact of climate \nchange on the value and credit rating of our assets. \nAs detailed in the scenarios chapter, we have invested \nin our capability to develop possible transition \npathways to differing temperature warming outcomes.\nThe scenarios presented show potential portfolio \nimpacts under a given scenario. They are not forecasts \nor predictions, nor are we saying they are equally likely. \nHowever, these scenarios do inform our transition risk \nunderstanding, identifying key sectors where transition \nis likely to be more disruptive, and potential timelines \nover key transitional shifts.\nAs a signatory of the United Nations Principles for \nResponsible Investment (UN PRI), we also monitor \nthe progress of the Inevitable Policy Response (IPR) \nscenario work.\nMeasurement\nClimate transition risks are primarily measured in \nrelation to our carbon exposures. We are committed \nto reducing the carbon footprint of both our operations \n(scope 1 and 2) and of our group balance sheet \nportfolio\u2019s GHG emissions intensity to align with the \n\u2018Paris\u2019 1.5\u00b0C objective.\nPortfolio carbon measurement and targets\nWe measure the contribution of our investments to \nCO2e emissions, calculating portfolio economic carbon \nemission intensities at both group and divisional level.\nThrough our climate scenario analysis, we measure \nthe risks to assets and liabilities. This is measured \nthrough the impacts on equity and bond valuations, \nand credit rating, in each scenario. \nAssessment of our investment portfolio is dependent \non good quality comparable cross-industry data and \ndisclosures of climate-related metrics and financial \nimpacts. This enables us to steer sustainability \ninvestments successfully, identify and manage risks, \ndeliver on our climate ambition of decarbonising our \nasset portfolio and comply with our own disclosure \nobjectives. We are supportive of the need for global \nconsistency with regards to reporting, disclosure \nand labelling. \nDirect carbon footprint \nWe measure and monitor the direct carbon emissions \nof all of our operational businesses. We have set SBTs \ncovering our scope 1 and 2 operational emissions. \nThese targets have been verified by the SBTi.\nManagement actions\nWe deploy a range of management actions to meet \nour risk management objectives, including:\n1. established framework for climate commitments \n2. exclusions and high carbon escalation\n3.  review our existing tolerance framework \nto incorporate climate considerations\n4. active engagement.\nThese actions seek to manage our exposure to \nclimate-related risks associated with our investments \nand operations and the risks that we do not achieve \nour climate-related goals and targets. \n1. Established framework for climate commitments \nAchieving our group commitments will be challenging, \nreflecting the complexity around addressing the systemic \nissue of climate change. Due to the transformational \nnature of a successful net zero transition, strong \npartnerships are needed to support a common vision \nand long-term objectives. These are necessary to \ndemonstrate the wider benefits of such a vision and to \nenable the required structural changes to achieve our \nclimate-related objectives. Before making commitments, \nwe undertake detailed analysis of the implications. \nThis ensures both that our climate commitments are \nintegrated within divisional strategies, and that the \ncommitments and actions of our divisions support our \noverall climate commitments. Our climate collaborations \ncan be found in the strategy chapter on page 14.\nOur framework accounts for all GHGs, and covers \nscope 1, 2 and material scope 3 emissions. Our \nprogress and long-term goals are supported by \nannual and interim targets to enable regular \nmonitoring of progress towards the commitment. \nProgress is reviewed and reported on at least annually \nand overseen by the GEC. Our commitments are \nconsistent with the latest science, and are credible and \nachievable. Our commitments are made in the \nexpectation that governments will follow through on \ntheir own commitments and required policy actions \nto ensure they remain aligned to \u2018Paris\u2019.\n2. Exclusions and high carbon escalation \nOur risk management approach recognises the \nimportance of engagement with investee companies. \nOur Investment Management Agreements (IMAs), with \nLGIM, have climate-specific exclusions that focus on \nkey areas of transition risk: CIP exclusions, coal and oil \nsand activity and deforestation. We also take account \nof the broader energy system within our portfolio \nmanagement approach \u2013 through our high carbon \nescalation process on an individual basis.\nHigh carbon escalation\nWe have established a process to escalate, through \nfurther governance, all proposed individual stock \ninvestments where the carbon intensity is greater than \na defined threshold across relevant sectors. This gives \nus an early warning system and a degree of control \nover the accumulation of risk through time.\nIssuers are assessed on a range of criteria including \nour assessment of the underlying transition and \nphysical risks. Our approach recognises that oil and \ngas will follow different phase-down pathways, and \nthat counterparties own transition plans will impact \non our assessment of the underlying risks. \nThe escalation process has had a real impact. In 2022, \n12 new issuers (out of a total of 36 considered) were \nadded to the exclusion list, increasing the total number \nof exclusions through this escalation process to 25. \nWe reinstated five issuers from last year\u2019s exclusion list \ndue to updated emission scores or updated transition \ncommitments. Results of the escalation process are \noverseen by the GEC.\nThe high carbon escalation process is also supported \nby exclusions where there is a clear incompatibility \nwith the 1.5\u00b0C \u2018Paris\u2019 objective. \nClimate Impact Pledge (CIP) exclusions\nOur CIP calls out stocks it excludes from the Future \nWorld fund range. These additional exclusions are \napplied to the group\u2019s proprietary assets managed by \nLGIM. LGIM sets out minimum standards, which if not \nmet, may translate into firm-wide voting sanctions and \ndivestment consequences for the funds adopting the \nCIP exclusions.\nWe typically engage with a company for 12 months. \nIf we still have concerns about the company\u2019s actions \nor strategy, the relevant business and asset managers \nagree a course of action. Companies in the current \npublished CIP exclusion list are added to our exclusion \nlist, helping to drive change in the market by supporting \nour engagement with the use of the group\u2019s own \nbalance sheet capital. This list is reviewed annually. \nThe rule applied to an excluded stock for these assets \nis \u2018Do not buy\u2019. \nLegal & General Group Plc Climate Report 2022"

We have \nimplemented targets that support our commitment \nto align with a 1.5\u00b0C \u2018Paris\u2019 objective.\nScope 3 investment portfolio economic carbon \nintensity: methodology and data approach\nOur primary metric is the GHG economic emissions \nintensity of the portfolio of group proprietary assets. \nThis is the total of all the GHG produced by our share \nof the companies and corporations that we invest \nin, per unit of investment, and is reported using carbon \ndioxide equivalent (CO2e) emission data. There are \nthree components to this metric:\n1. the GHG emissions, CO2e, in tonnes for each \nentity in which we are invested, arising from the \nunderlying scope 1 and 2 emissions \ndirectly connected with its operations\n2. a unit of value to normalise the emissions \nby the underlying size of the entity we are investing \nin, measured per \u00a3m. For our primary metric we use:\n\u2013 EVIC for corporate issuers\n\u2013 sovereign capital stock for sovereigns\n\u2013 market valuation for each real asset investment\n3. the size of our holding in the entity.\nThe investment portfolio emissions intensity is \nthen calculated by weighting the normalised emissions \n(tonnes of CO2e emissions per \u00a3m normaliser \nentity value as defined above) by the size of our \ninvestment and aggregating all holdings in our \ninvestment portfolio.\nWe have applied the emissions data equally to \nequities and bonds as they are both used by \ncorporates to raise capital and fund the business.\nOur calculation methodology for our primary \neconomic carbon intensity metric aligns with:\n\u2022 PCAF stock emission intensity methodologies1 \n(that is to say using EVIC as the stock emission \nintensity normaliser), where available\n\u2022 TCFD\u2019s carbon footprint portfolio weighting \nmethodology2 (that is to say stock intensities \nare weighted by portfolio value).\nWhile standards are still emerging, we also provide \nan alternative flow-based WACI metric, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by the revenues of the \nunderlying entity in the case of corporate issuers, and \nGDP in the case of sovereigns, as aligned to TCFD\u2019s \nequivalent methodology. We also have started to track \nphysical carbon intensity metrics, whereby the \nemissions are normalised by a measure of physical \noutput, for certain asset class and sector subsets \nof the portfolio, in line with SBTi requirements3. \nFurther detail on the methodology, including the \nsourcing and application of the underlying data \nused in these metrics can be found in the additional \ninformation chapter on page 49. There are large \nsegments of our portfolio where we have to rely \non estimated rather than actual emissions data, \nor where there is no data at all. We are also reliant \non third party data.\nScope 3 investment portfolio economic carbon \nintensity: 2022 results\nTable 5 shows the December 2022 group investment \nportfolio GHG emission intensity score of 73 tCO2e/\u00a3m \ninvested (-5% in 2022; and -23% from the 2019 base year).\n \nWhen applied to the \u00a379.4 billion4 of assets in this \nanalysis, this gives an absolute footprint of 5.8 million \ntCO2e emissions (2021: 7.3 million tCO2e).\nWithin the annual movement in 2022, 2% is attributed \nto the change in updated portfolio emissions (from \nupdated company carbon disclosures, and from \ntrading activity) by holding EVIC constant, as shown \nin the table below. Our reported emissions in 2021 \nwere impacted by the pandemic and the resultant \nimpact on corporate and economic activity. This year \nwe have witnessed a partial reversal of this movement \ndue to lags in reporting of the underlying emissions \ndata, as expected. \nA reversal of this movement is then attributed \nto changes in the EVIC of the investments in 2022, \nillustrating the impact that market movements can \nhave on economic emission intensity metrics.\nTable 5.

Where we are responsible \nfor the utility procurement, operation and management \nof our properties, through our managing agents, \nwe obtain energy and environmental data directly from \nsite utility meters or from utility suppliers. Where we \ndo not manage our properties, our occupiers provide \nutility data, or we use benchmark data based upon \nproperty type and floor area. We use the following \nbenchmark data sources: \n \n1. Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarking \n(GRESB) occupier data collection. As part of our \noccupier liaison processes, we currently receive \noperational data from approximately 31% of \nour occupiers. This data is an indication of \nthe emissions within our property portfolio. \n2. Industry standard benchmarks: Chartered Institute \nof Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) and Better \nBuildings Partnership\u2019s REEB. Energy (and carbon) \nbenchmarks for various types of property have \nbeen published in the UK for over 20 years, \noriginating from the government-funded Energy \nEfficiency Best Practice Programme (EEBPP). \nThe most recent update to these benchmarks \nwas undertaken by CIBSE in 20081. \n3. In addition, the Better Buildings Partnership has \nestablished more recent benchmarks for particular \ntypes of commercial buildings, predominantly \noffices and shopping centres. REEB 2020 office \nbenchmark was used for this analysis2. \n \nBy using a combination of these benchmarks, \nwe establish an estimate of the carbon emissions \nassociated with our direct property investments and \nalso identify which property sectors are, on average, \nmost intensive in terms of carbon emissions. \n \nFor commercial property, our operational footprint \n(scope 1 and 2) includes assets that are owned and \nmanaged in connection with our businesses. This \nincludes all assets we occupy where we procure \nenergy but also includes assets owned and managed \nby us, i.e. where we procure energy on behalf \nof external occupiers. The group scope 3 calculation \nadditionally brings in the emissions associated with \noccupier energy use. \n \nLTMs \nOur approach to LTMs is based on an analysis of the \nlending by purpose and is mapped to the portfolio \nsector average for the \u2018consumer non-cyclical\u2019 industry. \nOther assets \nWe have assumed that no emissions apply to the cash \nand derivative exposures. \n \nScope 3 investment portfolio carbon intensity: \ndetailed results \nThe impact of the rebasing activities that have been \ncarried out this year are highlighted in Table 6, where \nwe show their impacts on the equivalent metric as \nused for the production of last year\u2019s climate report. \nThis enables us to compare our 2022 metrics with \nthose from 2021 on a comparable basis, as shown \non page 33 of the main report. This rebasing activity \nhas included the upgrade of the calculation onto the \nLGIM Destination@Risk system, linking into an upgraded \nissuer-parent hierarchy and the shift from the Global \nIndustry Classification Standard (GICS) to the BICS \napproach for portfolio sector average proxy scores. \n \nThe table shows the impact of stepping through these \nchanges. This year\u2019s upgrade increased the economic \ncarbon intensity and a fall in the revenue-based \nmeasure. We have used these updated, rebased \nnumbers as the starting point for determining the \nchange in carbon intensity during 2022. \n1.
