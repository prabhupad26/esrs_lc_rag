This was achieved despite several severe challenges the company has been facing. While the global \neconomy started to recover, the coronavirus pandemic continued to impact industries and lives all over the \nglobe. In addition, the challenging market environment in China had an adverse impact on the company\u2019s \nbusiness activities. adidas was able to limit the impact from these headwinds as it quickly implemented \neffective countermeasures and took advantage of emerging opportunities. In March, the company \nlaunched its new strategy \u2018Own the Game.\u2019 Focusing on the most promising categories, channels, and \nmarkets in the highly attractive global sporting goods industry, \u2018Own the Game\u2019 is designed to significantly \nincrease sales and profitability, generate substantial free cash flow and create attractive shareholder \nreturns. In 2021 alone, the company returned \u20ac 1.6 billion to its shareholders through dividends and share \nbuybacks. At the same time, investments into product development, marketing, sponsoring, sustainability, \nand digitalization will increase strongly over the next couple of years, laying the foundation for long-term \nsuccess. Another important milestone in 2021 was the agreement to sell Reebok as it allows the company \nto focus its efforts on further strengthening the leading position of the adidas brand in the global sporting \ngoods market. Against this background, the company is well positioned to continue generating profitable \nand sustainable growth in 2022 and beyond."

The virtual pension account of the respective Executive Board member is credited annually with an amount equal to a percentage set by the Supervisory Board (2021: 50%) based\non the individual annual fixed compensation. The pension expenses for the pension benefits are calculated using actuarial calculations and therefore vary individually for each member of the \nExecutive Board. \n3 Based on the new compensation system for the members of the Executive Board, the compensation structure and thus the target total annual compensation of the members of the Executive\nBoard was adjusted as of January 1, 2021.

Thus, no adidas AG shares were acquired by the \nExecutive Board members as part of the 2020 LTIP tranche. For the 2020 financial year, a special bonus was granted to the members of the Executive Board incumbent as at \nDecember 31, 2020, for their outstanding performance in leading the company in times of the coronavirus pandemic. The special bonus amounted to 25% of the LTIP target amount \ndetermined for the 2020 financial year for each Executive Board member. The special bonus was granted share-based and invested into the acquisition of adidas AG shares after deducting \napplicable taxes and social security contributions in line with the conditions of the LTIP 2018/2020.

Including the dividend payment of \n\u20ac 585 million in May 2021, adidas AG returned nearly \u20ac 1.6 billion to its shareholders in 2021.

It is notable that the case satisfaction rate, which allows \nworkers to input their level of satisfaction with the resolution of complaints, has risen steadily from 39% in \n2019 to 58% in 2020 to 71% in 2021. The increase in satisfaction is partly related to a significant \nimprovement in the response time that it took the factory management to address workers\u2019 grievances, \nwhich decreased from 49 hours in 2020 to less than 16 hours in 2021 due to improvements in \ncommunication and transparency in the workplace. The management teams in the manufacturing facilities \nhave continuously engaged with the facility\u2019s workers through e-newsletters and broadcast messages, \nwhich improved the workers\u2019 engagement and the overall company culture."

Therefore, effective currency \nmanagement is a key focus of our Treasury department, with the aim of reducing the impact of currency \nfluctuations on non-euro-denominated net future cash flows. In this regard, hedging US dollars is a \ncentral part of our hedging program. This is a direct result of our Asian-dominated sourcing, which is \nlargely denominated in US dollars. In 2021, our Treasury department managed a net deficit of around \nUS $ 7.3 billion related to business activities (2020: US $ 6.1 billion). Thereof, around US $ 6.0 billion was \nagainst the euro (2020: US $ 4.8 billion). As governed by our Treasury Policy, we have established a \nhedging program on a rolling basis up to 24 months in advance, under which the vast majority of the \nanticipated seasonal hedging volume is secured approximately six months prior to the start of a season. In \nrare instances, hedges are contracted beyond the 24-month horizon. We had largely covered our \nanticipated hedging needs for 2022 as of the end of 2021. At the same time, we have already started \nhedging our exposure for 2023. The use or combination of different hedging instruments, such as foreign \nexchange contracts, currency options, and swaps, protects us against unfavorable currency movements. \n\u25ba SEE GLOBAL OPERATIONS   \u25ba SEE RISK AND OPPORTUNITY REPORT   \u25ba SEE NOTE 28"

To be able to execute this strategy successfully, adidas has changed its \norganizational structure. Since January 1, 2021, adidas manages Greater China as a separate market. \nThe remaining Asia-Pacific (APAC) market now comprises Japan, South Korea, Southeast Asia, and the \nPacific region. The change reflects the increasing importance of Greater China as a growth market for \nthe company. In addition, adidas created the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) market. To better \nleverage economies of scale, the company has integrated the former markets Europe, Russia/CIS, and \nEmerging Markets into the newly formed EMEA market. The markets North America and Latin America\nremain unchanged."

In addition, the Risk Owners need to determine a general risk-handling strategy for the \nidentified risks, which is either risk avoidance, risk reduction with the objective to lower impact or \nlikelihood, risk transfer to a third party or risk acceptance. The decision on the implementation of the \nrespective risk-handling strategy also takes into account the costs in relation to the benefit of any \nplanned mitigating action if applicable. The Risk Management department works closely with the Risk \nOwners to monitor the continuous progress of planned mitigating action and assess the viability of \nalready implemented mitigating action. Depending on the risk class determined by the risk and \nopportunity evaluation, the authority to make decisions to accept risks resides with the Executive \nBoard, leaders reporting directly to an Executive Board member and the operational management on \nthe next hierarchical level. The decision to accept material risks without taking additional mitigating \naction can only be made by the entire Executive Board. In its decision-making process, the Executive \nBoard takes into account the relationship between risk and opportunity profile (i.e., the company\u2019s \naggregated risk position) and risk appetite as well as risk capacity. To support the Executive Board, the \nRisk Management department defined clear thresholds for the likelihood that the company\u2019s \naggregated risk exceeds the defined risk appetite and risk capacity. The company\u2019s risk appetite must \nnot be exceeded with a likelihood of at least 95%; the company\u2019s risk capacity must not be exceeded \nwith a likelihood of at least 99%."

Employees can report compliance \nconcerns internally to their supervisor, the Chief Compliance Officer, Regional Compliance Managers \nor Local Compliance Officers, the relevant HR Manager, or, where applicable, the Works Council. \nEmployees can also report externally via the independent, confidential Fair Play hotline and website, \nwhich also allow for anonymous complaints. The Fair Play hotline and website are available at all times \nworldwide, including the services of interpreters, if required. They are promoted digitally and with \nposters to reach all our locations around the world.

This could lead to \nharmful competitive behavior, such as sustained periods of discounting in the marketplace or intense \nbidding for promotion partnerships.

Aggressive competitive practices could also \ndrive increases in marketing costs and market share losses, thus hurting the company\u2019s profitability and \nmarket position. The inability to adjust our distribution strategy in a timely manner to a changing retail \nindustry, which is experiencing rapid substitution of physical retail stores by digital commerce platforms \nas well as increasing connectivity between physical and digital retail, could result in sales and profit \nshortfalls. A decline in the attractiveness of particular shopping locations such as shopping malls could \nlead to sales shortfalls in our customers\u2019 and our own stores, higher inventory in the marketplace, \nincreased clearance activity and margin pressure."

The discount rate is set on \nthe basis of yields of high-quality fixed-rate corporate bonds at the balance sheet date provided there is a \ndeep market for such corporate bonds in a given currency.
