Currently, eligible employees of adidas AG and seventeen other \nsubsidiaries can participate in the plan. Up to two weeks before the start of an investment quarter each \neligible employee can enroll for the plan. The company accepts enrolment requests on the first day of the \nrelevant investment quarter. This is the grant date for the investment and matching shares. The fair value \nat the vesting date is equivalent to the fair value of the granted equity instruments at this date. The \nemployees invest an amount up to 10% of their gross base salary per quarter in the plan. A few days after \nthe end of the investment quarter the shares are purchased on the market at fair market value and \ntransferred to the employees. Thereby the amount invested during the quarter plus the top-up from adidas \nis used. These shares can be sold at any time by the employee. If the shares are held for a period of one \nyear after the last day of an investment quarter, employees will receive, as a one-off, free matching shares \n(one matching share for every six adidas AG shares acquired).
