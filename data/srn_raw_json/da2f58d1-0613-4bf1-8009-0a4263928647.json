In the year under review, 22.6 million passengers overall \ntravelled via Zurich Airport, a year-on-year increase of 120%, and 72% of the level in \n2019. The airport handled a total of 216,585 flight movements (+63% compared with \n2021). Thanks to our dependable airport partner companies and committed employees, \nairport operations ran very smoothly for the most part. On 15 June, following an internal \nIT hardware failure, the Swiss air navigation service Skyguide issued a \u201cclear the sky\u201d \norder to immediately close all of Switzerland's airspace. Good cooperation between the \ncrisis teams ensured that this incident was well managed."

Following the near-\ncollision of two aircraft at the runway intersection in 2011, Flughafen Z\u00fcrich AG, \nSkyguide, Swiss and the Swiss Air Force in 2012 prepared a comprehensive risk report \nwith the assistance of the Federal Office of Civil Aviation (FOCA) and the Department of \nthe Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC). In addition, various \nmeasures aimed at improving safety were implemented or are in the process of being \nimplemented. However, there is still a risk that capacity may be restricted due to safety \nconsiderations and that business performance may be negatively impacted as a result. \nThe planned taxiway around runway 28 will spatially separate inbound and outbound \naircraft for the most part. Compared with 2019, this will avoid more than 100,000 \ncrossings over runway 28 each year. The planned extensions to runways 28 and 32 will \nalso enable more stable operation in all weather conditions and for all aircraft types."

            "text": "The biggest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in Scope 1 at Zurich Airport is the \nairport's own combined heat and power generation plant which both produces electricity \nfor the airport and distributes heat over a district heating grid. Although the plant is \noperated efficiently with natural gas or fuel oil, it nevertheless emits a considerable \namount of greenhouse gases. Flughafen Z\u00fcrich AG is therefore working on reducing the \nenergy demand in its buildings. Each renovated building leads to lower energy demand \nthanks to better insulation, more efficient systems and new heating and cooling \nconcepts. For instance, the new Dock A scheduled for construction from 2030 will make \na major contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Numerous other measures \nplanned for various buildings will also help to lower energy demand even further."

            "text": "The central heating plant at Flughafen Z\u00fcrich AG, which produces most of the airport's \nheat, can be operated with both gas and heating oil. In the year under review, much less \ngas and more oil was used, which had a negative impact on CO  emissions, as oil has a \nmuch larger emission factor than gas. Nevertheless, the CO  emissions of the central \nheating plant were reduced overall. This was because, on the one hand, heating \nrequirements were lower than average owing to the mild autumn and lack of a cold spell \nand, on the other, because the purchase of biogas made it possible to save 1365 tonnes\nof CO . The greenhouse gas emissions of vehicles and machinery also declined slightly. \nTotal greenhouse gas emissions in Scope 1 at Zurich Airport amounted to 29,043 tonnes\nin the reporting period, i.e. 10% lower than in the previous year. Emissions in Scope 2, of \nlesser importance compared with Scope 1, rose owing to the recovery in passenger \nvolumes of 25% to 24 tonnes. Therefore, emissions in Scope 1 and 2 remained below \nthe key threshold of 30,000 tonnes per year, the interim target for 2020. Owing to the \nsubstantial rise in traffic, the greenhouse gas emissions in Scope 3, determined primarily \nby emissions of aircraft en route to their destinations, reflected a sharp increase (+95%).\n2\n2\n2"

In further rulings in 2010, the Swiss\nFederal Supreme Court definitively set the cut-off date for the foreseeability of an eastern\napproach as 1 January 1961 and, in 2011, it ruled definitively on the method used to \ncalculate a decline in the market value of investment property. In 2016, the Swiss Federa\nSupreme Court handed down two rulings in test cases regarding claims for \ncompensation relating to eastern and southern approach routes and, in 2018, it handed \ndown two rulings in test cases regarding cooperative ownership. In November 2019, the \nSwiss Federal Supreme Court handed down a ruling in test cases regarding the period of\nimitation on claims for compensation in Oberglatt. Based on these Swiss Federal \nSupreme Court rulings and other fundamental issues that have been decided, the \ncompany undertook a reappraisal of costs for formal expropriations at these dates, which \nn each case led to an adjustment to both the provision for formal expropriations and the \nntangible asset from the right of formal expropriation."

In further rulings in 2010, the Swiss \nFederal Supreme Court definitively set the cut-off date for the foreseeability of an eastern \napproach as 1 January 1961 and, in 2011, it ruled definitively on the method used to \ncalculate a decline in the market value of investment property. In 2016, the Swiss Federal \nSupreme Court handed down two rulings in test cases regarding claims for \ncompensation relating to eastern and southern approach routes and, in 2018, it handed \ndown two rulings in test cases regarding cooperative ownership. Based on these Swiss \nFederal Supreme Court rulings and other fundamental issues that have been decided, \nthe company undertook a reappraisal of costs for formal expropriations at these dates, \nwhich in each case led to an adjustment to both the provision for formal expropriations \nand the intangible asset from the right of formal expropriation. On 22 November 2019, \nthe Swiss Federal Supreme Court handed down a ruling in test cases regarding the \nperiod of limitation on claims for compensation in Oberglatt.

Management\u2019s \nassessment resulted in no impairment losses. \nFurther information regarding property, plant and equipment is included \nin the consolidated financial statements under note 6. \nWe mainly performed the following audit procedures: \n\u25ba Evaluation of design, implementation and effectiveness of controls \nembedded in the capital expenditure process and of controls \nsecuring existence of property, plant and equipment. \n\u25ba Assessment of the capitalisation of expenditure in assets under \nconstruction and reconciliation of capitalised expenditure to the \ninvoices received based on samples. \n\u25ba Examination of transfers from assets under construction to assets in \nuse based on the evaluation of effectiveness of internal controls \nand selected project completion protocols based on samples. \n\u25ba Evaluation of management\u2019s assessment of impairment indicators. \n\u25ba Assessment of management\u2019s assumptions (e.g. passenger \nvolumes, capital expenditure) used in the impairment model (value \nin use calculation). \n\u25ba Involvement of valuation experts to assist us in the evaluation of the \nimpairment model, assumptions used (e.g. discount-rate, terminal \ngrowth-rate) and assessment of the consistency of valuation \nmethodologies applied."
