The \nfollowing economic activities defined by the EU Taxonomy have \nbeen identified for the recognition and assignment of sales \nrevenues, CapEx, and OpEx of the D\u00fcrr Group: \n \n\u0216 3.1 Manufacture of renewable energy technologies\n \n\u0216 3.6 Manufacture of other low carbon technologies\n \n\u0216 4.11 Storage of thermal energy\nThe activity description \u201c3.6 Manufacture of other low carbon \ntechnologies\u201d is of particular relevance to the D\u00fcrr Group. Due to \nthe generic description of this economic activity, it is necessary \nto describe our interpretation in greater detail. The economic \nactivity includes activities for the production of technologies that \naim at substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in \nother sectors of the economy. From the D\u00fcrr Group\u2019s perspective, \na substantial reduction means a decrease in greenhouse gas \nemissions in the use phase by at least 20%. Such a substantial \nreduction can usually only be achieved by a technological leap \nand not by continuous improvements. We have therefore set the \nvalue of 20% as the minimum level for a substantial reduction in \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\nFor the 2022 fiscal year, the following business activities of the \nPainting technology\nDespite significant technological leaps in recent years, modern \npaint shops continue to be among the biggest energy consumers in \nthe production of automobiles. In particular, paint application and \ndrying of the car bodies are responsible for the majority of energy \nand resource consumption in paint shops. In addition to machines \nand systems that meet current market standards, we also sell \nsolutions with above-average energy-efficiency and resource-\nsavings that we classify as taxonomy-eligible due to the significant \nsavings of emissions. In the following, only those machines and \nsystems are identified as taxonomy-eligible that contribute to \na significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Examples \ninclude selected solutions for dry separation of paint overspray, \nsuch as EcoDryScrubber or EcoDryX, and our latest EcoProBooth \npaint booth concept. With the help of these technologies, energy \nconsumption during paint application in the paint booth can be \nreduced by up to 60% compared to conventional wet separation. \nIn the field of car body curing, the EcoInCure oven and the \nEcoSmart VEC fresh- and exhaust-air control system can achieve \na reduction in energy consumption of more than 20% compared to \nconventional drying systems. Furthermore, our intelligent energy \nnetwork EcoQPower contributes to a significant reduction in the \nenergy consumption of paint shops through an optimal combined \nheating and cooling system. These solutions are complemented in \nparticular by energy- and resource-saving technologies for paint \napplication, including the EcoPaintJet overspray-free application \nsystem, the EcoBell3 atomizer product line with twin main needle, \nthe EcoLCC color changer generation, and the EcoSupplyP special \npaint supply system.

Employees\u2019 needs are discussed at the individual Group \nsites between senior management, HR departments, employee \nrepresentatives, and the respective employees.\nProcesses and measures \nWe usually measure the satisfaction of our employees every \nthree years with the help of global surveys. If strikingly negative \nresults occur in certain organizational units, we use them to \nderive improvement measures and review the implementation and \nsuccess of the measures through follow-up surveys. \nThe most recent survey of our employees was conducted in 2019. \nA new survey was planned as per regular schedule for September \n2022. However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, we were not able \nto ensure at that time that all employees worldwide would, in fact, \nbe included in the same way. This affected our employees in China, \namong others. In addition, the significance and comparability of \nthe results would have been limited if a survey had been conducted \nunder the given circumstances, which is why the survey was \npostponed until September 2023. We normally conduct random \npulse surveys on focus topics at least once a year, usually \naddressing issues from the global employee survey. Since this \nsurvey could not take place in 2022, we did not conduct any pulse \nsurveys either.\nWe promote the satisfaction and retention of our employees \nthrough performance-related remuneration, further training \nand career opportunities, flexible working time models, and the \npossibility of mobile working, as well as through offers in the areas \nof work-life balance, sports, health, and culture. The majority of \nour German Group companies is covered by collective agreements. \nIn 2022, collective bargaining was additionally introduced at five \nGerman production companies of HOMAG; negotiations for further \nHOMAG production companies are ongoing.\nWe are convinced that job satisfaction and loyalty depend to \na large extent on a company\u2019s values and goals, as well as on \nits contribution to society and its purpose. In 2022, we took a \nclose look at this and developed a new corporate statement for \nthe D\u00fcrr Group as part of the OneVision project. With strong \nemployee participation \u2013 over 800 employees had their say \u2013 we \ndeveloped a new set of values and forward-looking statements \nfor mission, vision, and purpose.

In the following, we describe our \nprogress in the individual areas.\nENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT OF OUR PRODUCTS\nWe aim to reduce the environmental impact and climate effects \ncaused by the use of our products. The \u201cEU Taxonomy\u201d \n page 42  \nsection describes the extent to which our business activities \ncontribute to achieving the EU\u2019s environmental objectives.\nOur climate strategy includes the target of reducing emissions \nfrom the downstream value chain (Scope 3) by at least 15% by \n2030 compared to the 2019 base-year level. This depends to a \nlarge extent on the willingness of customers to use the resource- \nconserving, energy-efficient, and low-emission technologies we \noffer. In addition, emissions from our machines and systems can \nbe reduced considerably if green electricity is used for operation \ninstead of gas and conventional electricity. Therefore, the electri-\nfication of our products is one focus of our R&D agenda. \nAccording to our greenhouse gas balance, our products\u2019 use phase \nemissions represent by far the largest share of our total emissions \n(Scope 3.11). Our greatest leverage for reducing emissions thus \nlies in optimizing the energy consumption of our machines and \nsystems. We will publish detailed information on our Scope 3 \nemissions in the Sustainability Report, which will be released in \nmid-2023. \nENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT IN \nTHE SUPPLY CHAIN \nClimate aspects in the supply chain are a central issue for us. Even \nthough the share of our greenhouse gas emissions attributable \nto the supply chain (upstream value chain) is lower than the \nshare attributable to the use phase of our machines and systems \n(downstream value chain), the supply chain is still important for \nreducing emissions. We have therefore set ourselves the target \nof reducing emissions from the upstream value chain (Scope 3) \nby at least 15% by 2030 compared to the 2019 base-year level. We \nare working on a Group-wide concept to take the environmental \nimpact of our suppliers into account in our purchasing \nprocesses. For our high-risk suppliers, we use self-assessment \nquestionnaires throughout the Group that include, among other \nthings, information on environmental management certification. \nFurthermore, all suppliers of the D\u00fcrr Group are contractually \nobliged to comply with environmental laws and standards, based \non our Supplier Code of Conduct. In addition, potential high-risk \nsuppliers have been required to complete an e-learning module \non the topic of sustainability since 2022. Among other things, it \nprovides information on the D\u00fcrr Group\u2019s climate strategy and our \nexpectations from business partners regarding compliance with \nenvironmental and climate protection standards. From 2023, the \nconcept is to be complemented by a program that offers financial \nincentives for business partners using climate-friendly processes. \nIn logistics, we are planning measures to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions from 2023. For example, we want to avoid transport by \nair freight wherever possible and choose low-emission means of \ntransport in the future. The carbon footprint of logistics partners \nwill also play a role when awarding future contracts. \nNFS\nNFS", "blob_id": 1, "document_ref": "66"}, {"text": "to reduce consumption and emissions following an economic \nefficiency audit.

This represents a 43% reduction compared to \nthe previous year (approximately 48,000 tons) and a 51% reduction \ncompared to the 2019 base-year level. The emissions result mainly \nfrom site operations and the purchase of energy. The climate \nstrategy includes the target of reducing the environmental \nfootprint of our locations worldwide by 70% by 2030 (compared to \nthe 2019 base-year level). \nIn 2022, we already implemented various measures to reduce \nour Scope 1 and 2 emissions. For example, we commissioned \nphotovoltaic systems at our sites in Bietigheim-Bissingen, \nSchopfloch, Holzbronn, Shanghai, and Barcelona. In this way, we \ngenerated a total of 2,669 MWh of electricity in 2022 using our own \nphotovoltaic systems, of which we used approximately 70% for our \nown consumption. Furthermore, we have converted the locations \nin Germany, India, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and the United States \nto green electricity. We aim to convert our remaining locations in \n2023. Since the beginning of 2022, we have been using natural gas \nas a bridging technology for supplying heat in Germany, which is \nmade carbon-neutral by means of externally audited certificates \nfrom our energy supplier. However, our long-term goal is to \ngradually minimize gas consumption and switch to alternative \ntechnologies. Further emission reductions are to be achieved \nthrough the successive conversion of the entire company vehicle \nfleet in Germany to alternative drives by 2030 at the latest. \nTo support the achievement of our environmental and climate \ntargets, we organized a three-day ideas campaign at our German \nlocations in November 2022. More than 700 employees took part \nand submitted a total of 350 suggestions for greater sustainability. \nWe used the new \u201cSpark\u201d ideas management platform for this \ncampaign. We also strengthen the environmental and climate \nawareness of our employees through communication measures \non the intranet and through sustainability training, for example \nfor new employees or prospective managers. \nour energy providers (market-based). We will publish detailed \ninformation on the Scope 3 emissions in the Sustainability Report \n2022, which will be released in mid-2023.\n2.28 \u2014  KEY FIGURES FOR ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND \nENERGY INTENSITY\n2022\n2021\n20201\n20191\nEnergy consumption  \n(in MWh)\nHeating oil and gas\n64,633\n67,926\n66,148\n66,310\nElectricity from con-\nventional sources\n30,909\n49,974\n50,956\n57,976\nPurchased electric-\nity from renewable \nenergies\n25,982\n4,656\n3,235\n3,768\nSelf-used electricity \nfrom own generation2\n7,018\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\nDistrict heating\n8,334\n5,108\n3,986\n3,772\nTotal\n136,876\n127,665\n124,326\n131,825\nEnergy intensity \n (consumption in MWh \nper \u20ac1 million in sales)\nHeating oil and gas\n15.0\n19.2\n19.9\n16.9\nElectricity from con-\nventional sources\n7.2\n14.1\n15.3\n14.8\nPurchased electric-\nity from renewable \nenergies\n6.0\n1.3\n1.0\n1.0\nSelf-used electricity \nfrom own generation2\n1.6\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\nDistrict heating\n1.9\n1.4\n1.2\n1.0\nTotal\n31.7\n36.1\n37.4\n33.6\nEnergy consumption \nindexed  \n(in relation to sales;  \nbase year: 2019 = 100)\nHeating oil and gas\n89\n114\n118\n100\nElectricity from con-\nventional sources\n48\n96\n104\n100\nPurchased electric-\nity from renewable \nenergies\n627\n137\n101\n100\nSelf-used electricity \nfrom own generation3\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\nDistrict heating\n201\n150\n125\n100\nTotal\n94\n107\n111\n100\n UNAUDITED", "blob_id": 2, "document_ref": "67"}, {"text": "1 Adjustments due to recalculation on the basis of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol\n2 Data only collected since 2022, therefore no adjustment of previous year\u2019s figures.\n3  Since we have only been using self-generated electricity since 2022, a comparison wit\nprevious years or indexation is not possible. \nNFS", "blob_id": 3, "document_ref": "67"}, {"text": "Scope 3: Other indirect \n emissions (business flights)3\n7,482\n5,151\n5,024\n15,158\nCO\u2082e intensity  \n(in t per \u20ac1 million in sales)\nScope 1: Direct emissions \n(heating oil, gas, and vehicle \nfleet)\n4.13\n7.23\n7.60\n7.15\nScope 2: Indirect emissions1 \n(electricity, district heating)\n2.30\n6.45\n7.25\n7.31\nScope 3: Other indirect \n emissions (business flights)3\n1.73\n1.46\n1.51\n3.87\nCO\u2082e emissions indexed \n(in relation to sales; base year: \n2019 = 100)\nScope 1: Direct emissions \n(heating oil, gas, and vehicle \nfleet)\n58\n101\n106\n100\nScope 2: Indirect emissions1 \n(electricity, district heating)\n32\n88\n99\n100\nScope 3: Other indirect \n emissions (business flights)3\n45\n38\n39\n100\npandemic.

The D\u00fcrr Group does not currently \nmake use of the option to measure financial assets at fair value \nthrough profit or loss at initial recognition.\nLoss allowances and impairment of financial assets \nThe D\u00fcrr Group uses an impairment model based on the expected \ncredit loss model, which is applicable for all financial assets \n(debt instruments) that are measured at amortized cost or at fair \nvalue through other comprehensive income. The expected credit \nloss model distinguishes between the general approach and the \nsimplified approach. The general approach allocates the financial \nassets to three risk stages and is mainly applicable for cash and \ncash equivalents as well as sundry financial assets. For contract \nassets, trade receivables and lease receivables, the simplified \nmodel is applied and thus the first of the three risk levels is not \nconsidered.\nIf there has been a significant increase in the credit risk since \ninitial recognition, the assets are allocated to stage 2. A number \nof qualitative and quantitative criteria are used to assess whether \nthe credit risk has increased significantly since a financial asset \nwas recognized for the first time. This involves, for example, \nexamining whether the total comprehensive income of the debtor \nhas deteriorated significantly or whether it is expected to do \nso. Financial assets are allocated to stage 2 at the latest when \ncontractual payment is more than 30 days past due.\nFinancial assets are allocated to stage 3 or their default is \nassumed if circumstances occur that could impair the ability of a \ncertain debtor to meet their financial obligations. For all financial \nassets, this means observing the criteria of being 90 days past due \nas well as using qualitative credit ratings for debtors. For example, \nthe likelihood of insolvency or any other financial reorganization of \nthe debtor results in the financial assets being allocated to stage 3. \nIn deviation from the past due criteria mentioned above, trade \nreceivables and contract assets which are measured in accordance \nwith the simplified approach are allocated to stage 3 when more \nthan twelve months past due. This appropriately reflects the \nindustry-specific experience and payment patterns for long-term \nprojects in the plant and machinery construction sector. \nFinancial assets are derecognized as soon as reasonable \ninformation is available that indicates that they are uncollectible, \nsuch as insolvency proceedings coming to an end or following", "blob_id": 2, "document_ref": "166"}, {"text": "Under the general model, the D\u00fcrr Group allocates the financial \nassets to the individual risk stages.

With the exception of the \nconvertible bond, Schuldschein loans, liabilities to banks and \nobligations from options, the fair value of liabilities approximates \nthe carrying amount. \nThe fair value of the convertible bond (fair value hierarchy level 1) \nis calculated by multiplying the nominal value with the quoted \nprice at the end of the reporting period. As of the reporting date, \nthe convertible bond was listed at 108.26% (prior period: 134.38%), \nwhich is equal to a market value of \u20ac 162,390 thousand (prior \nperiod: \u20ac 201,570 thousand). \nThe fair value of the Schuldschein loans as well as liabilities to \nbanks (fair value hierarchy level 2) is determined by discounting \nthe cash flows as of the measurement date with discount rates \nwith matching terms.  \nThe obligations from options measured at amortized cost (level 3 \nin the fair value hierarchy) primarily relate to the sundry financial \nliabilities recognized under the domination and profit and loss \ntransfer agreement with HOMAG Group AG for the acquisition \nof shares as well as to settle the compensation entitlements. \nThe sundry financial liabilities are recognized through profit \nor loss in the subsequent measurement.

On account \nof the new pool agreement concluded with the shareholder group \nSchuler/Klessmann in the 2021 reporting period and the initial \nruling of the Stuttgart Regional Court, the price of the shares \nwas increased from \u20ac 25.00 to the expected exercise price of \n\u20ac 31.58 in the 2021 reporting period and the term assumed for \nthe measurement was adjusted, causing the liability to increase \naccordingly. Compared to expectations in the prior period, the \nterm of the arbitration proceedings was extended by one year. \nThe fair value is determined using a net present value model \nbased on the cash settlement including compensation payment \nas well as the legal minimum interest rate and a discount rate \nwith a matching term.
