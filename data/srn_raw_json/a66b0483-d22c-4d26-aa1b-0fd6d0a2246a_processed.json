This frame-\nwork entails, for example, that the Getinge Executive Team \nconducts an annual evaluation of material risks and their effect on \nGetinge\u2019s operations, and decides on measures to reduce risks and \ntheir potential effects. This work is continuously monitored by the \nGetinge Executive Team during the year. \nThe Getinge Executive Team\u2019s risk evaluation is reported to the \nBoard of Directors and serves as a key starting point in determining \nthe areas that Corporate Internal Audit is to examine. \nThe three Business Areas are fully responsible for their results. \nIn addition, the three Business Areas and the Global Sales and \nService organization are owners of risk in their respective areas. \nAccordingly, they have their own risk-management structures in their \nrespective operations. Corporate functions assist the Business \nAreas and the Global Sales and Service organization in managing \nrisks in a number of areas by providing governance. The group \nsupport functions are responsible for supporting and coordinating \nthe development of the organization and driving synergies in their \nrespective areas.\nA number of established forums that focus on risks of a \nparticular nature conduct regular evaluation and monitoring to \nensure correct coordination and management from a Group \nperspective. To continuously identify, manage and follow up on \nrisks, several forums have been established such as Ethics \nCommittee, Sustainability Board and the forum for the Group\u2019s risk \nmanagers, as well as a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)  \nto manage cyber risk and the Getinge Centre of Excellence to \naddress cybersecurity related to the Group\u2019s products. This is  \nin addition to quarterly risk follow-up with Business Areas and  \nthe Global Sales and Service organization.\nRisk assessment \nBy conducting quantitative and qualitative risk analyses based on \nthe offering and operations, Getinge identifies the key risks that \ncould prevent the achievement of business and financial targets.  \nIn addition, several units in each Business Area and in the Global \nSales and Service organization are analyzed to gain a more detailed \nunderstanding of the actual compliance of existing rules and  \nregulations. Measures to manage identified risks are thereafter \nformulated. \nThe overall responsibility for identifying and addressing \npotential risk areas lies with the Getinge Executive Team and the \nbusiness operations. The Ethics & Compliance and Corporate \nInternal Audit functions assist with support and ongoing monitor-\ning as well as investigations and internal audit, which help to \nidentify risk.\nIn 2022, Getinge has continued its efforts to strengthen risk \nidentification, preventive measures and management through \nCorporate Internal Audit and the Corporate Risk Management \nfunction. Management of the Group\u2019s risks is based on Getinge\u2019s \ndecentralized structure, since knowledge about risks in the Group \nis present in operations.\nThe Getinge Executive Team has identified six priority risk areas \nresulting from the group-wide analysis performed in 2022, which \nare presented in the table on the following pages. In addition to \nthese priority risks, regular measures are taken to manage other \nrisks according to needs and resource availability. Each of the \nprimary risk areas is owned by a specific member of the Getinge \nExecutive Team and work is being conducted to identify specific \nrisks in each area and develop plans to prevent risks, mitigate the \npotential effects and deliver on these plans. \nIt is important to note that the risks presented on the following \npages are not an exhaustive description of the Group\u2019s risk \nexposure. However, these are the risks that have been deemed to \nbe most relevant for the Group to actively manage.\nGetinge\u2019s insurance program\nStrategy\nThe Group works actively with loss prevention activities, for \nexample, through its extensive quality activities and by preventing \ninterruption risks in the operations. Getinge is to act as if the Group \nwere uninsured. That means that Getinge continuously considers \nrisk factors and manage them as part of the daily work. Actively \nmonitoring incidents and correcting underlying causes means that \nclaims related to product liability can be prevented. The insurance \nprogram exists to protect the consolidated balance sheet and to \navoid fluctuations in the income statement.\nGroup-wide insurance program\nGetinge has a group-wide insurance program that encompasses \nthe global operations. The aim is to cover insurable risks with \nadequate limits based on current risk exposure levels. Insurance \npolicies have been entered into with insurance companies with \nhigh credit ratings and a documented ability to provide claims \nassistance. A joint insurance program creates economies of scale \nand ensures a harmonized approach to limits and deductibles. It \nalso creates a platform for building a balanced and cost-efficient \nprogram to prevent fluctuations in earnings.\nCustomer value\nStable and standardized insurance coverage for the Group\u2019s  \nglobal operations also adds customer value since it is required in \nmany tender and procurement processes and when commercial \ncontracts are signed.\nEthics & Compliance\nThe above risk signaling system is supplemented by the Ethics & \nCompliance function.

Sweden. A description of the company\u2019s operations  \nis included in the Administration Report on page 58. \nThe consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending \nDecember 31, 2022 have been approved by the Board on March 30, \n2023 and will be presented to the AGM on April 26, 2023 for adoption.\nAccounting and measurement policies\nGetinge\u2019s consolidated financial statements have been prepared \nin accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards \n(IFRS), issued by the International Accounting Standards Board \n(IASB), as adopted by the EU. In addition, the Swedish Financial \nReporting Board\u2019s recommendation RFR 1 has been applied. The \nconsolidated financial statements include the financial statements \nfor Getinge AB (publ) and its subsidiaries and were prepared in \naccordance with the cost method. The Parent Company applies  \nthe same accounting policies as the Group, except in the instances  \nstated below in the section \u201cParent Company\u2019s accounting \npolicies.\u201d The differences that arise between the Parent Company \nand the Group\u2019s accounting policies are attributable to the limited \nopportunities for the application of IFRS in the Parent Company, \nas a result of the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and the Swedish \nPension Obligations Vesting Act. The Parent Company\u2019s functional  \ncurrency is Swedish kronor (SEK), which is also the Parent \nCompany\u2019s and Group\u2019s presentation currency. This means that the \nfinancial statements are presented in Swedish kronor (SEK). Unless \notherwise stated, all amounts are given in millions of Swedish kronor \n(SEK M). For practical reasons, the figures in this Annual Report \nhave not been rounded off, which is why notes and tables may not \ntotal correct amounts.\nSignificant estimates and assessments\nTo prepare the financial statements in accordance with IFRS, the \ncompany management is required to make assessments and  \nassumptions that affect the recognized amounts of assets and \nliabilities and other information in the financial statements as well \nas the revenues and expenses recognized during the period.  \nAssumptions, assessments and estimates are reviewed on a regular \nbasis. The actual outcome may diverge from these assumptions, \nassessments and estimates. The Board of Directors and Getinge \nExecutive Team have deemed that the following areas may have a \nsignificant impact on Getinge\u2019s earnings and financial position: \nMeasurement of identifiable assets and liabilities in connection \nwith acquisitions\nIn conjunction with acquisitions, all identifiable assets and liabilities \nin the acquired company are measured at fair value, including the \nvalue of assets and liabilities in the previously owned share as well \nas the share attributable to non-controlling interests.\nGoodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life\nThe impairment requirement for goodwill and other intangible \nassets with an indefinite useful life is tested annually by Getinge in \naccordance with the accounting policy described here in Note 1. \nThe recoverable amount for cash generating units (CGUs) has been \nestablished through the measurement of value in use. For these \ncalculations, certain estimations must be made (see Note 12).\nPension commitments\nRecognition of the costs of defined-benefit pensions and other  \napplicable retirement benefits is based on actuarial valuations,  \nrelying on key assumptions for discount rates, future salary increases \nand expected inflation. In turn, the discount rate assumptions are \nbased on rates for high-quality fixed-interest investments with \ndurations similar to the pension plans (see Note 24).\nWrite-down of inventories\nInventories are recognized at the lower of cost according to the first \nin/first out principle, and net realizable value. The value of invento-\nries is adjusted for the estimated decrease in value attributable to \nproducts no longer sold, surplus inventories, physical damage, lead \ntimes for inventories, and handling and sales overheads. If the net \nrealizable value is lower than the cost, the inventories are written \ndown to this amount (see Note 13).\nDeferred tax\nThe measurement of loss carryforwards and the company\u2019s ability \nto utilize unutilized loss carryforwards is based on the company\u2019s \nassessments of future taxable income in various tax jurisdictions \nand includes assumptions regarding whether expenses that have \nnot yet been subject to taxation are tax deductible. Deferred tax is \nrecognized in profit or loss unless the deferred tax is attributable  \nto items recognized in other comprehensive income, in which  \ncase the deferred tax is recognized together with the underlying \ntransaction in other comprehensive income (see Note 8).\nCapitalized product development costs\nCosts for product development projects are capitalized to the ex-\ntent that the costs can be expected to generate financial benefits. \nCapitalization starts when management believes that the product \nwill be technically or financially viable. This means that established \ncriteria must be met before a development project is capitalized \nas an intangible asset. Capitalization ends and amortization of the \ncapitalized development costs starts when the asset is ready for \nuse. Capitalized development costs are tested for impairment when \nthere are indications of a decline in value. Determining the amor-\ntization period and testing for impairment require management to \nmake assessments.\nDisputes and claims for damages\nProvisions for disputes and claims for damages represent manage-\nment\u2019s best estimate of the future cash flow required to settle the \nobligations. The disputes primarily relate to contractual commit-\nments in contracts with customers and suppliers and damages \nrelated to product liability. Management\u2019s assessment is that the \nneed for a provision or contingent liability depends on the legal \nprocesses in the country in question and the course of the proceed-\nings. Opinions from external and internal advisors are taken into \nconsideration, as is experience from similar cases. The results of \ncomplicated disputes and claims for damages may nevertheless be \ndifficult to predict and disputes could be both time-consuming and \ncostly (see Notes 22 and 26).", "blob_id": 1, "document_ref": "78"}, {"text": "Consolidated financial statements\nSubsidiaries are all companies (including structured entities) over \nwhich the Group exercises a controlling influence. The Group con-\ntrols a company when it is exposed to or has the right to variability \nof returns from its holding in the company and can affect these \nreturns through its influence over the company. The controlling \ninfluence is usually transferred at the acquisition date. Acquired \ncompanies are consolidated into the consolidated financial \nstatements in accordance with the purchase method, which means \nthat the cost of the shares in subsidiaries is eliminated against their \nequity at the acquisition date. Accordingly, only the portion of the \nsubsidiary\u2019s equity that has arisen after the acquisition is included \nin consolidated equity. Equity in the subsidiaries is thus determined \non a market-based value of identifiable assets, liabilities, provisions \nand contingent liabilities on the date of the acquisition. If the cost \nof the shares in the subsidiaries exceeds the value of the acquired \nnet assets, calculated as described above, the difference is \nassigned to goodwill. If the acquisition cost falls below the fair value \nof the acquired subsidiary\u2019s net assets (a bargain purchase), the \ndifference is recognized directly in profit or loss as other operating \nincome. If assets are included in the subsidiary at the time of acqui-\nsition \u2013 for example, property, participations or other operations \u2013 \nthat will not be retained but sold in the near future, these assets are \nrecognized in the acquisition analysis at the amount expected to be \nreceived. Deferred tax is calculated on the difference between the \ncalculated market values of assets and liabilities and the fiscal  \nresidual values. Intra-Group transactions and unrealized inter- \ncompany profits are eliminated in the consolidated financial \nstatements, without respect of shares in non-controlling interests. \nIn profit or loss, net profit is recognized without deductions for \nForeign currencies\nFunctional currency\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional \ncurrency of the financial statements according to the exchange \nrate on the date of the transaction. Receivables and liabilities \nin foreign currencies are measured at the closing day rate, and \nunrealized currency gains and losses are included in profit or loss. \nExchange rate differences attributable to operating receivables \nand liabilities are recognized as other operating income/operating \nexpenses. Exchange rate differences regarding financial assets  \nand liabilities are recognized under Other financial items. When \npreparing the consolidated financial statements, the balance \nsheets of the foreign operations are translated from their functional \ncurrency to SEK, based on the closing day rate.\nTranslation of foreign operations\nGetinge applies the current method for translation of foreign sub-\nsidiaries\u2019 balance sheets and income statements. This means that \nall assets and liabilities in subsidiaries are translated at the closing \nday rate, and all income statement items are translated at average \nannual exchange rates. Translation differences arising in this \ncontext are due to the difference between the income statement\u2019s \naverage exchange rates and closing day rates, and to the net assets \nbeing translated at a different exchange rate at year-end than at the \nbeginning of the year. Translation differences are recognized under \nother comprehensive income. The total translation differences in \nconjunction with divestments are recognized together with the \ngains/losses arising from the transaction. Hedge accounting is  \napplied to external loans raised in order to reduce translation \neffects in exposed currencies to match the net assets in foreign \nperformance obligations can be divided into products and services. \nRevenue recognition of sales of products usually takes place at a \npoint in time when the goods are delivered and when collection of \nthe receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue is normally recog-\nnized once the buyer has accepted delivery and after installation \nand final inspection. Revenue from services is recognized over time \nwhen the services are performed. Income from rental is allocated to \na particular period over the term of the rental agreement.\nInterest income is recognized continuously and dividends \nreceived are recognized after the right to the dividend is deemed \nsecure. In the consolidated financial statements, intra-Group sales \nare eliminated. For larger assignments that meet the criteria for \nrevenue recognition over time, revenue and expenses are recog-\nnized in relation to the degree of completion of the assignment \non the closing date. The degree of completion of an assignment is \nestablished in a ratio between accrued assignment costs for work \ncompleted on the closing date and the calculated total assign-\nment costs, except in those instances this does not correspond \nto the degree of completion. Changes in the scope and claims of \nthe assignment are included only if there is an agreement with \nthe customer. When the outcome of an assignment cannot be \ncalculated in a reliable manner, only the amount corresponding \nto the accrued assignment costs that will probably be paid by the \nclient is recognized as revenue. Other accrued assignment costs \nare recognized as costs in the period in which they occur. If it is \nprobable that the total amount of accrued assignment costs will \nexceed total revenue from the assignment, the expected loss is \npromptly recognized as a cost in its entirety.\n \nGovernment grants", "blob_id": 2, "document_ref": "79"}, {"text": "ssets in foreign \ne loans are  \nme for the Group.\nafter discounts, \necognized when \nservice and is able \ntinge\u2019s overall \nGovernment grants\nGovernment grants are measured at fair value when it is probable \nthat the terms associated with the grants will be met and that the \ngrants will be received.

Such grants affect recognized earnings over the \nasset\u2019s useful life by reducing depreciation (see Note 33). \nFinancial income and expenses\nFinancial income and expenses include interest income on bank \ndeposits and receivables, interest expenses on loans, income from \ndividends, unrealized and realized profits and losses on financial \ninvestments, exchange rate differences, and the change in value of \nderivative instruments used in financial activities. Borrowing costs \nin conjunction with the raising of loans are recognized as part of  \nthe loan to which they pertain and are charged to profit or loss \nduring the term of the loan.\nIntangible assets\nGoodwill\nGoodwill comprises the portion of a purchase price for an acquisi-\ntion that exceeds the market value of the identifiable assets, with \ndeductions for liabilities and contingent liabilities, calculated on \nthe acquisition date, on the share of the acquired company\u2019s assets \nacquired by the Group. In a business acquisition whereby the acqui-\nsition costs are less than the net value of acquired assets, assumed \nliabilities and contingent liabilities, the difference is recognized \ndirectly in profit or loss. Goodwill arising in conjunction with the \nacquisition of a foreign entity is treated as an asset in the foreign \nentity and translated at the exchange rate on the closing date. \nGoodwill arising from the acquisition of associated companies is \nincluded in the value of the holdings in the associated company. \nAn impairment test of goodwill is conducted once per year or more \noften if there is an indication that there could have been a decrease \nin value. Impairment of goodwill is recognized in profit or loss. The \ngain or loss in connection with the divestment of an entity includes \nthe residual carrying amount of goodwill that pertains to the \ndivested unit. \nOther intangible assets\nOther intangible assets comprise capitalized development costs, \ncustomer relations, technical know-how, trademarks, agreements \nand other assets. Intangible assets are recognized at cost with  \ndeductions for accumulated amortization and any impairment \nlosses. Amortization is applied proportionally over the asset\u2019s anti- \ncipated useful life, which usually varies between three and 15 years. \nAcquired intangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill \nif they fulfill the criteria for qualifying as an asset, implying they can \nbe separated or they are based on contractual or other legal rights \nand that their market value can be established in a reliable manner. \nIntangible assets that are recognized separately from goodwill in \nacquisitions of operations include customer relations, technical \nknow-how, trademarks, agreements, etc. \nAcquired intangible assets are measured at market value and \namortized on a straight-line basis over their anticipated useful life. \nThe useful life can, in certain cases, be indefinite. These intangible \nassets are not amortized, instead they are tested for impairment \nevery year or more often if there is an indication that there could \nhave been a decrease in value. Costs for development, whereby \nresearch results or other knowledge is applied to produce new \nproducts, are recognized as an asset in the balance sheet to \nthe extent that these products are expected to generate future \nfinancial benefits. These costs are capitalized when management \ndeems that the product is technically and financially viable, which \nis usually when a product development project has reached a \ndefined milestone in accordance with an established project \nmodel. The capitalized value includes expenses for material, direct \nexpenses for salaries and indirect expenses that can be assigned \nto the asset in a reasonable and consistent manner. In other cases, \ndevelopment costs are expensed as they arise. Research costs \nare charged to earnings as they arise. Capitalized expenses are \namortized on a straight-line basis from the point in time at which \nthe asset is put into commercial operation and during the asset\u2019s \nestimated useful life. The amortization period is determined based \non historical data and taking into consideration future changes in \ntechnology. For capitalized development costs, the amortization \nTangible assets\nProperties, machinery, equipment and other tangible assets are \nrecognized at cost, with deductions for accumulated depreciation \nand any impairment losses. The cost includes the purchase price \nand expenses directly attributable to the asset to bring the asset to \nthe site and in the working condition for its intended use. Examples \nof directly attributable expenses included in the cost are delivery \nand handling costs, installation, legal services and consultancy \nservices. Assets provided to the company in conjunction with the \nacquisition of new subsidiaries are recognized at market value \non the acquisition date. Depreciation is conducted straight line. \nThe value in the balance sheet represents acquisition costs with \ndeduction for accumulated depreciation and any impairment \nlosses. Land is not depreciated since it is deemed to have an infinite \neconomic life, however, the depreciation of other assets is based on \nthe following anticipated useful lives: \nClass of assets\nDepreciation, \n number of years\nLand improvements\n40\u201350\nBuildings\n10\u201350\nMachinery\n5\u201325\nEquipment\n10\nProduction tools\n5\nRental equipment\n5\nCars\n4\nComputer equipment\n3\nTangible assets comprising parts with different useful lives are \ntreated as separate components of tangible assets.

Risk management \nis regulated by the finance policy adopted by the Board with an  \nassociated Treasury directive decided by the Getinge Executive \nTeam and is revised every year. The ultimate responsibility for \nmanaging the Group\u2019s financial risks and developing methods  \nand principles of financial risk management lies with the Getinge \nExecutive Team and the finance function. Getinge\u2019s financial  \nactivities are centralized to benefit from economies of scale, to \nensure good internal control and to facilitate monitoring of risk.\nCurrency risks \nCurrency risks comprise exchange-rate fluctuations, which have \nan impact on the Group\u2019s earnings and equity. Currency exposure \noccurs in connection with payments in foreign currency (trans- \naction exposure) and when translating foreign subsidiaries\u2019 balance \nsheets and income statements to the presentation currency SEK \n(translation exposure). \nTransaction exposure\nThe Group\u2019s payment flows in foreign currencies are mainly  \ngenerated by export sales, with the largest flows in USD, EUR,  \nCNY and JPY. Getinge\u2019s finance policy stipulates that forecast  \nnet flows in foreign currency can be hedged for up to 24 months. \nHedging is conducted using currency forwards, currency swaps  \nand currency options. The market value of financial currency \nderivative instruments that meet the cash flow hedging  \nrequirements amounted to SEK -27 M (-22) on December 31, 2022.\n \nTranslation exposure \u2014 balance sheet\nWhen translating net assets of foreign subsidiaries into SEK,  \na translation difference occurs, which can affect consolidated \nother comprehensive income. Although Getinge does not have  \nthe specifically stated goal of hedging translation exposure,  \nthe Group\u2019s lending in foreign currency took place in currencies \nthat limit translation exposure.\nImpact of exchange-rate fluctuations\nThe effect of exchange-rate movements on earnings and equity \nbelow is calculated using volumes and earnings in foreign currency \nfor 2022, taking into consideration currency hedging that has been \nconducted. In addition, there is the exchange-rate impact on net  \nfinancial items related to interest expenses in foreign currencies. \nFor a rate movement of 5%, the impact on equity of a remeasurement \nof the Group\u2019s portfolio of currency derivatives held for hedging \npurposes is about SEK 16 M. At a 5% rate movement, the impact of \nother translation effects on equity is approximately SEK 1,414 M. \nThe extent to which earnings are impacted by exchange-rate  \nfluctuations is detailed in the following table, based on the \nexchange rates specified.\nCurrency:  \nestimated rate in 2023\nNet volume in \n2022, millions\nImpact in SEK \nM of 5% rate \nmovement\nCNY: 1.50 \n987 \n+/- 74\nEUR: 11.13\n-199\n+/- 111\nJPY: 0.0792\n8,300 \n+/- 33\nUSD: 10.44 \n343\n+/- 179\nderivative instruments at year-end. If the average interest rate for \ncurrencies represented in the Group\u2019s loan portfolio at the end of \nthe year changed by 1 percentage point, this would affect profits  \nby +/- SEK 41 M on an annual basis. \nFinancing and liquidity risks\nFinancing risk is defined as the risk of the cost being higher and \nfinancing opportunities limited as the loan is renegotiated. This \nalso includes not being able to fulfill payment commitments as a \nresult of insufficient liquidity or difficulties in securing funding.  \nFinancing risk can arise through disruptions in the financial \nmarkets, for example, decisions on new regulations or the imple-\nmentation of recently enacted laws. Getinge endeavors to have an \ninvestment grade credit rating. The Group\u2019s existing credit facilities \nare currently deemed to be sufficient.\nThe Group\u2019s sources of financing primarily comprise equity, cash \nflow from operating activities and borrowing. To reduce financing \nrisks, the Group strives to diversify its sources of financing and \nmaturities according to the Group\u2019s finance policy and financing \nstrategy. The single largest loan is a syndicated loan of EUR 490 M \nwith seven banks, of which EUR 70 M falls due in 2023 and  \nEUR 420 M in 2024. In 2022, the Group renewed the existing MTN \nprogram from 2012 to issue bonds in the Swedish capital market. \nSEK 2,544 M was outstanding under this program at the end of \n2022, of which SEK 570 M is a three-year social bond in accordance \nwith the ICMA Social Bond Principles, meaning that the proceeds \nwill exclusively be used for increasing production of ECMO equip-\nment and DPTE\u00ae-BetaBags. \nIn addition to these credit facilities, the Group has short-term \nuncommitted credit lines. For further information on these credit", "blob_id": 2, "document_ref": "104"}, {"text": "Credit and counterparty risks \nThe Group\u2019s financial transactions cause credit risks with regard to \nfinancial counterparties. Financial credit risks or counterparty risks \nconstitute the risk of losses if the counterparties do not fully meet \ntheir commitments. The management of the Group\u2019s financial credit \nrisk is regulated in the finance policy through accepting only \ncreditworthy counterparties and fixed limits, which are continuously \ncontrolled. As of December 31, 2022, the total counterparty \nexposure in derivative instruments was SEK 39 M (0). The Group  \nhas signed standard netting agreements (ISDA) with counter- \nparties for currency transactions and interest-rate swaps. These \nagreements permit relevant financial assets and liabilities to be \noffset. Transactions take place within established limits and \nexposures are continuously monitored.\nCommercial credit risks are limited by a diversified customer \nbase with a high credit rating. The Group\u2019s customers are found \nprimarily in the public sector, which means that its credit risk is \ngenerally very low. The credit risk for Getinge\u2019s customers in the \nprivate sector is also deemed to be low. When deemed necessary, \ncredit risk is managed using letters of credit or export credit- \nrelated guarantees. The provision for doubtful receivables at \nyear-end totaled SEK 256 M (253).\nThe Group\u2019s accounts receivable are presented in Note 14,  \nwhich shows that the share of past due accounts receivable on \nDecember 31, 2022 amounted to SEK 1,440 M in relation to the total \nvolume of accounts receivable, which amounted to SEK 5,531 M. \nfor hedge accounting. When the Group hedges purchases and sales \nin foreign currency, a hedging relationship is entered into whereby \nthe critical terms of the hedging instrument match the terms of the \nhedged item. In this way, a qualitative assessment of the effective-\nness of the hedging relationship is performed and the relationship \nis expected to be effective for the period for which it is valid.\nThe Group also enters into interest-rate swap agreements that \nhave the same critical terms as the hedged item. Critical terms \nmay be benchmark interest rates, reset dates, currency, maturities \nand nominal amount. The Group does not hedge 100% of the \nprincipal and thus identifies only a portion of the principal \noutstanding that corresponds to the nominal amount of the swap. \nThe Group applies hedge accounting. \nAll derivatives are classified under level 2 of the value hierarchy. \nFair value measurements for currency forwards are based on \npublished forward rates in an active market. The measurement  \nof interest-rate swaps is based on forward rates as expressed in \nmarket yield curves. Getinge has no interest-rate swaps outstanding \nas of December 31, 2022.\nBased on changes to existing loan agreements, Getinge has \nwaived its right to draw the currencies and tenors affected by the \ncurrent IBOR reform for the syndicated loan (EUR 490 M), effective \nJanuary 2022. Interest on the loan outstanding of USD 75 M \n(maturing in July 2024) was renegotiated and thus no LIBOR \nexposure exists on December 31, 2022. \nContingent considerations\nGetinge signed agreements on contingent considerations in \nconnection with acquisitions of business and subsidiaries. The \nliabilities for these additional purchase prices are measured at fair \nvalue through profit or loss. In most cases, the additional purchase \nprices are contingent on securing government approval for the \nacquired product development projects and, to a lesser extent, \ncontingent of the earnings performance of the acquired businesses. \nThe future cash flows are discounted if the planned disbursement \ndate exceeds 12 months. Assessments about future cash flows \nlinked to the contingent considerations are regularly reviewed by \ncompany management and the fair value is adjusted if necessary. \nThe discount effect is recognized on an ongoing basis in profit or \nloss under financial items. \n \nContingent considerations\n  \n2022\n  \n2021\nOpening balance\n404\n38\nBusiness combinations\n100\n364\nPayments\n-19\n\u2013\nDiscount effect\n21\n2\nTranslation differences\n65\n0\nClosing balance\n571\n404\nContingent considerations are included in the item Other", "blob_id": 2, "document_ref": "105"}, {"text": "due  \n currency \ndge is \nhe \ny \nements \nFair value disclosures pertaining to borrowing  \nand other financial instruments \nEssentially, all loans have floating interest rates and, accordingly, \nthe fair value is assessed as corresponding to the carrying amount. \nContingent considerations are measured at fair value at Level 3 of \nthe fair value hierarchy.

They are considered \nmaterial if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be \nexpected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the \nbasis of the consolidated financial statements.\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined certain \nquantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall group \nmateriality for the consolidated financial statements as a whole. \nThese, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to deter-\nmine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of \nour audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, \nboth individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as \na whole.\nKey audit matters\nKey audit matters of the audit are those matters that, in our \nprofessional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the \nannual accounts and consolidated accounts of the current period. \nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of, and in \nforming our opinion thereon, the annual accounts and consolidat-\ned accounts as a whole, but we do not provide a separate opinion \non these matters.", "blob_id": 3, "document_ref": "125"}, {"text": "We conducted our audit in accordance with International \n Standards on Auditing (ISA) and generally accepted auditing \nstandards in Sweden.

In carrying out this risk assessment, and in order to design \nprocedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, the auditor \nconsiders those elements of internal control that are relevant to \nthe preparation of the Esef report by the Board of Directors and \nthe Chief Executive Officer, but not for the purpose of expressing \nan opinion on the effectiveness of those internal controls.

(2021: 67%).\nProgress 2022:\nThe employee engagement survey that was carried out in 2022 \nhad a response rate of 76% and an engagement score of 71%. The \nresults mirror an appreciation of a clear purpose, and pride in what \nthe company does. Other strong areas include a good work\u00adlife \nbalance and trust in colleagues within working teams. \nDIVERSITY, EQUITY, INCLUSION  \nAND BELONGING\nDiversity, equity, inclusion and belonging (DEIB) are essential to \nimproving creativity and decision\u00admaking, driving innovation and \nenhancing Getinge\u2019s ability to increase the reach of its solutions \nand technologies. A culture where everyone feels respected and \nappreciated for who they are increases employee well\u00adbeing.\nAs an employer, it is important for Getinge to attract the best \ncompetence and the best skills and talent and to remove barriers \nto opportunities regardless of race, ethnic origin, gender identity, \ngender expression, sexual orientation, disability, religion, creed, \nage, class or socio\u00adeconomic status, or any other characteristics \nprotected by applicable law. \nPositive effects of DEIB on the economy include a potential for \nincreased productivity, improved creativity and greater innovation. \nDiverse groups can bring more perspectives and experiences to \nproblem solving, leading to better performance and increased \ncompetitiveness. In addition, the promotion of diversity and \ninclusion can help Getinge to attract and retain colleagues from \ndifferent backgrounds, which can lead to increased employee \nengagement and reduced costs as a result of staff turnover.\nBy promoting diversity and inclusion, Getinge can better under\u00ad\nstand and respond to the needs of society, including those who are \ntraditionally marginalized. A negative effect of not working with \ndiversity, equity, inclusion and belonging can, for example, lead to a \nformation of homogeneous teams which may lead to \u2018groupthink\u2019, \nwhich means that fewer ideas are given space.\nFrom a human rights perspective, diversity initiatives are \nimportant to promote equal opportunities for all individuals. Lack \nof diversity and inclusion can lead to discrimination and prejudice, \nwhich can have a negative impact on the well\u00adbeing of individuals \nand limit their opportunities for advancement. By promoting \ndiversity and inclusion, the company wants to reduce the risk of \nthese negative effects and ensure equal access to opportunities \nand resources for all.\nThe potential negative consequences of not working on diversity, \nequity, inclusion and belonging are primarily a result of business \nrelationships. As an employer, potential negative consequences \ncan in the most serious case, be discrimination or neglect of \nensuring equal access to opportunities and resources.\nGetinge\u2019s Commitment \nDiversity and inclusion are essential aspects of the way of work\u00ad\ning at Getinge. The global Diversity Directive clearly outlines the \ncommitment to providing equal employment opportunities to all, \nwithout unlawful discrimination. Getinge\u2019s target is to increase fe\u00ad\nmale representation across the company to reach gender balance \nboth at management and employee levels. In order for diversity to \nflourish, the company has started monitoring inclusion and belong\u00ad\ning through the company engagement survey. \nManagement approach \nAs part of the commitment to having a diverse and inclusive \nworkplace, Getinge has zero tolerance towards discrimination, \nharassment and bullying. Victimization at work, such as recurring \nnegative actions directed against individual employees, is not per\u00ad\nmitted. All employees shall treat one another with respect, dignity \nand common courtesy. Getinge wants all employees to have equal \nopportunities based on competence, experience and performance, \nregardless of gender identity, race, ethnicity, religion, age, marital or \nparental status, disability, sexual orientation, nationality, political \nopinion, union affiliation, social background and/or other character\u00ad\nistics protected by applicable law.

The medical device industry is not considered to have a high \nexposure to climate change risks. This does not, however, mean \nthat long\u00adterm exposures to both physical and transition risks \nrelated to climate change in the value chain do not exist. The main \nrisks that can be identified are the impact extreme weather and \nrising sea levels may have in certain parts of the supply chain. An \ninternal assessment concludes that the exposure to physical risks \nin own facilities is relatively low. The transition risks are related \nto demand for products with reduced climate impact as well as \nreduced amount of packaging and increased legal and compliance \nrequirements in the ESG arena in particular in the EU. \nMitigation: To reduce the emissions from the company value \nchain, net zero targets have been established and the carbon emis\u00ad\nsion reduction targets are submitted to the Science Based Targets \ninitiative (SBTi) and validation will be done during 2023.", "blob_id": 2, "document_ref": "155"}, {"text": "emissions from the use of products.\nManagement approach\nAll Getinge production sites are certified to ISO 14001 standard. \nAn interdisciplinary work group with appointed leaders from \ninvolved corporate functions and all business areas has worked \nto implement roadmaps at production sites to reduce energy \nconsumption and emissions in Scope 1 and 2 from production to \nmeet the reduction targets.

Packaging \nis essential to maintain the sterility of the products reaching the \nmarketplace. To secure this sterility, strict regulations are followed. \nThis makes change to the type and amount of packaging difficult \nas the main focus is on ensuring patient safety. The medical device \nsector is highly regulated, and developing alternatives to dispos\u00ad\nable (plastic) materials is an industry\u00adwide challenge. The company \nis open to potential partnerships with suppliers and other industry \nactors to understand the availability of renewable materials and to \ndevelop solutions to handle plastic and other waste and recycling.\nAssessment of impacts and management of risks\nHealthcare waste contains potentially harmful microorganisms \nthat can infect patients, healthcare workers and the general public. \nOther potential hazards may include drug\u00adresistant microorganisms \nwhich can spread from health facilities into the environment. The \ndisposal of untreated healthcare waste in landfills can lead to the \ncontamination of drinking, surface, and ground waters if those \nlandfills are not properly constructed. The treatment of healthcare \nwaste with chemical disinfectants can result in the release of chem\u00ad\nical substances into the environment if those substances are not \nhandled, stored and disposed in an environmentally sound manner. \nProper downstream waste handling can help reduce the \nenvironmental impact as recycling and waste reduction efforts \ncan conserve resources, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and \nminimize the need for landfill space. Proper waste handling can \nhelp protect human health by minimizing exposure to hazardous \nwaste and preventing the spread of diseases caused by improper \nwaste disposal. If waste is not managed properly, it can lead to \nenvironmental degradation, such as pollution of air, soil, and water. \nThis can have negative impacts on wildlife and ecosystems, as \nwell as on human health. The negative impacts from an economic \nperspective include, among others, the cost of clean\u00adup and and \nrestoration. Improper waste handling could potentially violate \nhuman rights, particularly of marginalized communities, as low\u00ad \nincome communities often are disproportionately impacted by \nenvironmental pollution and waste disposal facilities.\nGetinge is involved in waste management from its own opera\u00ad\ntions, but also affects the amount of waste generated by customers \n(downstream) through the packaging and sale of single\u00aduse items, \nwhich are mainly made of plastic.\nMitigating the risks \nProduct safety and clinical performance can never be compromised. \nThis means that changing materials in the products or in the \nprimary packaging is not an option unless the same level of safety \nand sterility can be maintained.", "blob_id": 2, "document_ref": "158"}, {"text": "https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/health-care-waste", "blob_id": 3, "document_ref": "158"}, {"text": "Universeum\nSweden\u2019s national science center, using playful methods to  \nteach children and adults about science, nature and sustainable \ndevelopment.\nReason for partnership: Support Universeum in its mission to \nstrengthen skills and innovation, and to contribute to sustainable \nsocietal development with a particular focus on health.\nPartnership since: 2020\nThe Foundation for Queen Silvia Children\u2019s Hospital\nThe foundation supports children and young people every day  \nwho are being treated for both physical and mental illnesses.\nReason for partnership: Support the important work to bring \njoy into the everyday lives of children and young people who are \ndealing with various illnesses.\nPartnership since: 2020\nImage: Pratham Sweden", "blob_id": 1, "document_ref": "159"}, {"text": "CORPORATE PARTNERSHIPS\nGetinge\u2019s social responsibility commitment is centered on meeting \nhealthcare challenges such as an increasing population and longer \nlife expectancies that increase the pressure on healthcare systems. \nGetinge also wants to make a positive impact in wider society by \ncollaborating with non\u00adprofit organizations.

See page 156 for conversion factors and \nheat values used for Gas and Oil. Getinge uses CO2e emission \nfactors that may include small amounts of converted CH4 and N2O, \nwhere applicable. \nGetinge does not report on other ozone depleting substances \nor greenhouse gases, neither on biogenic CO2 emissions. The base \nyear for calculation is 2019 emission values, if not stated otherwise. \nThe base year has been chosen as internal systems have been \nharmonized across all production sites during the year. \nScope 1 and 2 GHG emissions are calculated based on the \nGreenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting \nStandard (Revised Edition). Global Scope 1 emission factor for fuel \ncombustion (2,7 kg CO2/KWh) is from the Department for Business, \nEnergy and Industrial Strategy 2020 Government GHG Conversion \nFactors for Company Reporting, inline with IPCC 2006 Guidelines \nfor National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.

Scope 3 GHG emissions are defined as \nall other indirect emissions that occur in a company\u2019s value chain. \nThe GHG Protocol Standard includes 15 categories of Scope 3 GHG \nemissions that organizations are required to report. \nMaterial categories for Scope 3 GHG emissions reporting are \ndetermined using the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope \n3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. \nWith regards to scope 3, the main achievement during 2022 has \nbeen the analysis of all 15 categories of emissions and establishing \na baseline from 2021 to be able to set Science Based Targets. The \ncategories which have the largest impact on emissions in the value \nchain are sourcing of materials (~30%), distribution and logistics \n(~10%) and the use of products (~45%).\nBased on Getinge\u2019s commitment to the Science Based Targets \ninitiative (SBTi), Getinge has defined its emission reduction targets \nand submitted the baseline for validation by the SBTi in 2022.\nGetinge\u2019s Scope 3 emissions baseline 2021 has been estimated \nusing the spend based approach. For 2022, Getinge strives to \nswitch to a weights\u00adbased approach, including information from \nour suppliers, consultants, and conversion factors sourced from \npublicly available databases. \nGetinge will report Scope 3 emission figures after validation of \nthe targets and baseline by the SBTi in 2023. \nRECs (Renewable Energy Certificate) is a type of Energy Attribute \nCertificate (EAC) that represents the environmental attributes of \nthe generation of a one\u00admegawatt hour (MWh) of energy produced \nby renewable sources. Using EACs, end\u00adusers around the world \ncan make reliable claims about their energy usage from renewable \nsources. As RECs are accepted by SBTi/GHG Protocol, purchasing \nRECs is not regarded as \u201coffseting\u201d at Getinge. \nIn 2022, switching to certified carbon neutral energy products \n(i.e. via RECs) has accounted for 22% (2,351 tons CO2e) of the over \nall emission reduction in Scope 1 & 2  in production.\nCarbon Credits, Verified Carbon Units or VCUs\nEach VCU represents a reduction or removal of one tonne of carbon \ndioxide equivalent (CO2e) achieved by a project, but do not contrib\u00ad\nute to the increase of energy production from renewable sources. \nTherefore, carbon credits are not accepted as emission reduction \nby the SBTi. At Getinge, the purchase of carbon certificates to \nneutralize emissions from non\u00adrenewable sources is regarded as \n\u201coffseting\u201d. It helps to neutralize emissions as an interim solution \nwhile plans are implemented to increase energy efficiency, reduce \nenergy consumption and switch to renewable energy sourcing \nwherever possible. \nLocal emission reductions based on this approach are not \nincluded in the company reporting of emission reductions.
