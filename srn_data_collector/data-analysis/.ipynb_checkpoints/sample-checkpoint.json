Impacts on the undertaking\u2019s own workforce can originate in its strategy or business model in a number of different ways. For example, impacts may relate to the undertaking\u2019s value proposition (such as providing lowest cost products or services, or high-speed delivery, in ways that put pressure on labour rights in its own operations), or its cost structure and the revenue model (such as shifting inventory risk to suppliers, with knock-on effects on the labour rights of people who work for them)."}, {"text": "ESRS_S1:::DISCLOSURE_REQUIREMENT_RELATED_TO_ESRS_2_SBM-3:::application_requirements:::AR 7\nAR 7. Impacts on the undertaking\u2019s own workforce that originate in the strategy or business model can also bring material risks to the undertaking. For example, risks arise if some people in the workforce are at risk of forced labour, and the undertaking is importing products into countries where the law allows for the confiscation of imported goods that are suspected of being made with forced labour. An example of opportunities for the undertaking may result from providing opportunities for the workforce such as job creation and upskilling in the context of a \u201cjust transition\u201d. Another example, in the context of a pandemic or other severe health crisis, relates to the undertaking potentially relying on contingent labour with little to no access to sick care and health benefits that may face severe operational and business continuity risks as workers have no choice but to keep working while sick, further exacerbating the spread of the disease and causing major supply chain breakdowns. Reputational and business opportunity risks linked to the exploitation of low-skilled, low-paid workers in sourcing geographies with minimal protections for them are also increasing with media backlash and consumer preferences moving to more ethically sourced or sustainable goods."}, {"text": "ESRS_S1:::DISCLOSURE_REQUIREMENT_RELATED_TO_ESRS_2_SBM-3:::application_requirements:::AR 8\nAR 8. Examples of particular characteristics of people in the undertaking\u2019s own workforce that may be considered by the undertaking when responding to paragraph 15 relate to young people that may be more susceptible to impacts on their physical and mental development, or women in a context where women are routinely discriminated against in the terms and conditions of work, or migrants in a context where the market for the supply of labour is poorly regulated and workers are routinely charged recruitment fees. For some people in the workforce, the inherent nature of the activity that they are required to undertake may put them at risk (for example, people required to handle chemicals or operate certain equipment or low paid employees who are on \u201czero hours\u201d contracts)."}, {"text": "ESRS_S1:::DISCLOSURE_REQUIREMENT_RELATED_TO_ESRS_2_SBM-3:::application_requirements:::AR 9\nAR 9. With regard to paragraph 16, material risks could also arise because of the undertaking\u2019s dependency on its own workforce where low-likelihood but high-impact events may trigger financial effects; for example, where a global pandemic leads to severe health impacts on the undertaking\u2019s workforce resulting in major disruptions to production and distribution. Other examples of risk related to the undertaking\u2019s dependency on its workforce include a shortage in skilled workers or political decisions or legislation affecting its own operations and own workforce.

Impacts on value chain workers can originate in the undertaking\u2019s strategy or business model in a number of different ways. For example, impacts may relate to the undertaking\u2019s value proposition (such as providing lowest cost products or services, or high-speed delivery, in ways that put pressure on labour rights in the upstream and downstream value chains), its value chain (such as relying on commodities of unclear provenance, without visibility on impacts on workers), or its cost structure and the revenue model (e.g. shifting inventory risk to suppliers, with knock-on effects on the labour rights of their workers)."}, {"text": "ESRS_S2:::DISCLOSURE_REQUIREMENT_RELATED_TO_ESRS_2_SBM-3:::application_requirements:::AR 7\nAR 7. Impacts on value chain workers that originate in the strategy or the business model can also bring material risks to the undertaking. For example, in the context of a pandemic or other severe health crisis, undertakings that rely on contingent labour with little to no access to sick care and health benefits may face severe operational and business continuity risks as workers have no choice but to keep working while sick, further exacerbating the spread of the disease and causing major supply chain breakdowns. Another example is where selling goods premised on cheapest prices for customers create operational risks as suppliers under extreme price pressure may sub-contract production, leading to lower quality, and a longer, less transparent, and less controllable supply chain. Reputational and business opportunity risks linked to the exploitation of low-skilled, low-paid workers in sourcing geographies with minimal protections for them are also increasing with media backlash and consumer preferences moving to more ethically sourced or sustainable goods."}, {"text": "ESRS_S2:::DISCLOSURE_REQUIREMENT_RELATED_TO_ESRS_2_SBM-3:::application_requirements:::AR 8\nAR 8. Examples of particular characteristics of value chain workers that may be considered by the undertaking when responding to paragraph 12 relate to young workers that may be more susceptible to impacts on their physical and mental development, or women workers in a context where women are routinely discriminated against in the terms and conditions of work, or migrant workers in a context where the market for the supply of labour is poorly regulated and workers are routinely charged recruitment fees. For some workers, the inherent nature of the activity that they are required to undertake may put them at risk (e.g., workers required to handle chemicals or operate certain equipment or low paid workers who are on \u201czero hours\u201d contracts)."}, {"text": "ESRS_S2:::DISCLOSURE_REQUIREMENT_RELATED_TO_ESRS_2_SBM-3:::application_requirements:::AR 9\nAR 9. With regard to paragraph 13, material risks could also arise because of the undertaking\u2019s dependency on value chain workers where low likelihood but high impact events may trigger financial effects; for example, where a global pandemic leads to severe health impacts on workers at all stages of the value chain resulting in major disruptions to production and distribution. Other examples of risk related to the undertaking\u2019s dependency on value chain workers include a shortage in skilled workers or political decisions or legislation affecting value chain workers working for logistics providers. For example, if some workers in the undertaking\u2019s value chain are at risk of forced labour, and the undertaking is importing products into countries where the law allows for the confiscation of imported goods that are suspected of being made with forced labour.

Impacts on affected communities can originate in the undertaking\u2019s strategy or business model in a number of different ways. For example, impacts may relate to the undertaking\u2019s value proposition (such as, construction or commencement of projects with timelines that do not allow sufficient time for consultation with groups affected by the projects), its value chain (for example, land-use in countries in which ownership is often contested or records are unreliable or in which land-users such as indigenous peoples are unrecognised), or its cost structure and the revenue model (such as, aggressive strategies to minimise taxation, particularly with respect to operations in developing countries)."}, {"text": "ESRS_S3:::DISCLOSURE_REQUIREMENT_RELATED_TO_ESRS_2_SBM-3:::application_requirements:::AR 6\nAR 6. Impacts on affected communities that originate in the strategy or business model can also bring material risks to the undertaking. For example, where the undertaking\u2019s strategy involves moving into higher risk geographies in pursuit of certain commodities, and if affected communities resist its presence or object to its local practices, this may create extensive and costly delays, and affect the undertaking\u2019s ability to secure future land concessions or permits.

Examples of particular characteristics of affected communities that may be considered by the undertaking when responding to paragraph 10 may be an affected community that is physically or economically isolated and is particularly susceptible to introduced diseases or has limited access to social services and therefore relies on infrastructure set up by the undertaking. It may be because where land worked by women is purchased by the undertaking and payments go to male heads of households, women become further disenfranchised in the community. It may also be because the community is indigenous, and its members seek to exercise cultural or economic rights to the land owned or used by the undertaking \u2013 or by one of the entities with which it has a business relationship \u2013 in a context where their rights are not protected by the state. In addition, the undertaking shall consider whether different characteristics overlap. For example, characteristics such as ethnicity, socioeconomic status, migrant status and gender may create overlapping risks of harm for certain affected communities, or for distinct parts of those affected communities, since affected communities are often heterogeneous in nature."}, {"text": "ESRS_S3:::DISCLOSURE_REQUIREMENT_RELATED_TO_ESRS_2_SBM-3:::application_requirements:::AR 8\nAR 8.
