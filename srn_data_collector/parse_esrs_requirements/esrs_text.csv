for the quantification of indirect GHG emissions from imported energy in ISO 
14064-1:2018;
(b) include purchased or acquired electricity, steam, heat, and cooling consumed by 
the undertaking; 
(c) avoid double counting of GHG emissions reported under Scope 1 or 3;
(d) apply the location-based and market-based methods to calculate Scope 2 GHG 
emissions;
Note: Location-based method quantifies Scope 2 GHG emissions based on 
average energy generation emission factors for defined locations, including local, 
subnational, or national boundaries (GHG Protocol, �Scope 2 Guidance�, 
Glossary, 2015);
Note: Market-based method quantifies Scope 2 GHG emissions based on GHG 
emissions emitted by the generators from which the reporting entity contractually 
purchases electricity bundled with instruments, or unbundled instruments on their 
own (GHG Protocol, �Scope 2 Guidance�, Glossary, 2015); in this case, the 
undertaking may disclose the share of market-based scope 2 GHG emissions 
linked to purchased electricity bundled with instruments such as Guarantee of 
Origins or Renewable Energy Certificates.
(e) disclose biogenic emissions of carbon from the combustion or biodegradation of 
biomass separately from the Scope 2 GHG emissions but include emissions of 
other types of GHG (in particular N2O). In case the emission factors applied do 
not separate the percentage of biomass or biogenic CO2, the undertaking shall 
disclose this. In case GHG emissions other than CO2 (particularly N2O) are not 
available for, or excluded from, location-based grid average emissions factors or 
with the market-based method information, the undertaking shall disclose this;
(f) exclude any purchased, sold or transferred carbon credits or GHG allowances 
from the calculation of Scope 2 GHG emissions; 
(g) adhere to the rules as set out in chapter 7.1 of the GHG Protocol Scope 2 
Guidance (version 2015 or the latest one) and disclose the required information 
accordingly; 
(h) disclose carbon uptakes and emissions (CO2, CO, CH4) from indirect land use

it may consider the corresponding requirements for the quantification of indirect 
GHG emissions from ISO 14068:2018;
(b) if it is a financial institution, consider the GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard 
for the Financial Industry from the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financial 
(PCAF);
(c) screen its total Scope 3 GHG emissions based on the 15 Scope 3 categories 
identified by the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard and GHG Protocol Corporate 
Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (Version 2011) using 
appropriate estimates. Alternatively, it may screen its indirect GHG emissions 
based on the categories provided by ISO 14064:2018 clause 5.2.4 (excluding 
indirect GHG emissions from imported energy);
(d) identify its significant Scope 3 categories based on the magnitude of their 
estimated GHG emissions and other criteria provided by GHG Protocol Corporate 
Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (Version 2011, p. 63 
and 65-68) or ISO 14064-1:2018 Annex H.3.2, such as financial spend, influence, 
related transition risks and opportunities or stakeholder views;
(e) calculate or estimate GHG emissions in significant Scope 3 categories using 
emissions factors recommended by the GHG protocol such as IPPC, ASHRAE 
Standard 34 / World Resources Institute and The Climate Registry;
(f) at least update the Scope 3 inventory every three years and in case of major 
changes (Explanatory note: Scope 3 GHG emissions need to be disclosed every 
year, but a full update of the underlying inventory is only expected every three 
years unless major changes occur);
(g) disclose the percentage of emissions calculated using primary data obtained from 
suppliers or other value chain partners;
(h) for each significant Scope 3 GHG emissions category, disclose the reporting 
boundaries considered, the calculation methods for estimating the GHG 
emissions as well as if and which calculation tools were applied. The Scope 3 
categories should be consistent with the GHGP and include:
i. indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions from the consolidated accounting group 
(the parent and its subsidiaries), 
ii. indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions from associates, joint ventures, and 
unconsolidated subsidiaries for which the undertaking has the ability to 
control the operational activities and relationships (i.e., operational control),
iii. Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions from associates, joint ventures, 
unconsolidated subsidiaries (investment entities) and joint arrangements
for which the undertaking does not have operational control and when these 
entities are part of the undertaking�s value chain.
(i) disclose a list of Scope 3 GHG emissions categories included in and excluded 
from the inventory with a justification for excluded Scope 3 categories;
(j) disclose biogenic emissions of carbon from the combustion or biodegradation of 
biomass that occur in its value chain separately from the gross Scope 3 GHG 
emissions, and include emissions of other types of GHG (such as N2O), and 
emissions of CO2 that occur in the life cycle of biomass other than from 
combustion or biodegradation (such as GHG emissions from processing or 
transporting biomass) in the calculation of Scope 3 GHG emissions; 
(k) exclude any purchased, sold or transferred carbon credits or GHG allowances 
from the calculation of Scope 3 GHG emissions;
(l) disclose carbon uptakes and emissions (CO2, CO, CH4) from land use and land 
use change in its value chain separately from the Scope 3 GHG emissions, but 
include emissions of other types of GHG when applicable.",
