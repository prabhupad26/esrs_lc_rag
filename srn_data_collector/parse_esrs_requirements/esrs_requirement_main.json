Non-state-based grievance mechanisms include those administered by the undertaking, either alone or together with stakeholders, such as operational-level grievance mechanisms and collective bargaining, including the mechanisms established by collective bargaining. They also include mechanisms administered by industry associations, international organisations, civil society organisations, or multi­stakeholder groups.\n\n\nOperational-level grievance mechanisms are administered by the organisation either alone or in collaboration with other parties and are directly accessible by the organisation’s stakeholders. They allow for grievances to be identified and addressed early and directly, thereby preventing both harm and grievances from escalating. They also provide important feedback on the effectiveness of the organisation’s due diligence from those who are directly affected.\n\n\nAccording to UN Guiding Principle 31, effective grievance mechanisms are legitimate, accessible, predictable, equitable, transparent, rights-compatible, and a source of continuous learning. In addition to these criteria, effective operational-level grievance mechanisms are also based on engagement and dialogue. It can be more difficult for the organisation to assess the effectiveness of grievance mechanisms that it participates in compared to those it has established itself.",

Indirect impact drivers operate diffusely by altering and influencing direct drivers (by affecting their level, direction or rate) as well as other indirect drivers. Interactions between indirect and direct drivers create different chains of relationship, attribution, and impacts, which may vary according to type, intensity, duration, and distance. These relationships can also lead to different types of spill-over effects. Global indirect drivers include economic, demographic, governance, technological and cultural ones. Special attention is given, among indirect drivers, to the role of institutions (both formal and informal) and impacts of the patterns of production, supply and consumption on nature, nature’s contributions to people and good quality of life.",
        "Impact materiality": "A sustainability matter is material from an impact perspective when it pertains to the undertaking’s material actual or potential, positive or negative impacts on people or the environment over the short-, medium- and long-term.

        "Waste": "Any substance or object which the holder discards or intends or is required to discard\n40\n\n\n.",
        "Waste hierarchy": "Priority order in waste prevention and management\n41\n:\n\n\nI.prevention;\n\n\nII.preparing for re-use;\n\n\nIII.recycling;\n\n\nIV.other recovery (e.g., energy recovery); and\n\n\nV.disposal.",
        "Waste management": "The collection, transport, recovery and disposal of waste, including the supervision of such operations and the after-care of disposal sites, and including actions taken as a dealer or broker\n42\n.",
        "Wastewater": "Water which is of no further immediate value to the purpose for which it was used or in the pursuit of which it was produced because of its quality, quantity, or time of occurrence.\n\n\nWastewater from one user can be a potential supply to a user elsewhere. Cooling water is not considered to be wastewater.",
        "Water consumption": "The amount of water drawn into the boundaries of the undertaking (or facility) and not discharged back to the water environment or a third party over the course of the reporting period.",
        "Water discharge": "The sum of effluents and other water leaving the boundaries of the organisation and released to surface water, groundwater, or third parties over the course of the reporting period.",
        "Water intensity": "A metric providing the relationship between a volumetric aspect of water and a unit of activity (products, sales, etc.) created.",
        "Water (recycled and reused)": "Water and wastewater (treated or untreated) that has been used more than once before being discharged from the undertaking’s or shared facilities’ boundary, so that water demand is reduced. This may be in the same process (recycled) or in a different process within the same facility (own or shared with other undertakings) or in another of the undertaking’s facilities (reused).",
        "Water scarcity": "The volumetric abundance, or lack thereof, of freshwater resources. Scarcity is human driven, it is a function of the volume of human water consumption relative to the volume of water resources in a given area. As such, an arid region with very little water, but no human water consumption would not be considered scarce, but rather arid. Water scarcity is a physical, objective reality that can be measured consistently across regions and over time. Water scarcity reflects the physical abundance of freshwater rather than whether that water is suitable for use. For instance, a region may have abundant water resources (and thus not be considered water scarce) but have such severe pollution that those supplies are unfit for human or ecological uses.",
        "Water withdrawal": "The sum of all water drawn into the boundaries of the undertaking from all sources for any use over the course of the reporting period.",
        "Workers’ representatives": "Workers' representatives means:\n\n\nI.trade union representatives, namely representatives designated or elected by trade unions or by members of such unions in accordance with national legislation and practice;\n\n\nII.duly elected representatives, namely representatives who are freely elected by the workers of the organisation, not under the domination or control of the employer in accordance with provisions of national laws or regulations or of collective agreements and whose functions do not include activities which are the exclusive prerogative of trade unions in the country concerned and which existence is not used to undermine the position of the trade unions concerned or their representatives.",
        "Work-life balance": "Satisfactory state of equilibrium between an individual’s work and private life. Work-life balance in a broader sense encompasses not only the balance between work and private life given family or care responsibilities, but also time allocation between time spent at work and in private life beyond family responsibilities.",
        "Work-related hazards": "Work-related hazards  can be:\n\n\nI.physical (e.g., radiation, temperature extremes, constant loud noise, spills on floors or tripping hazards, unguarded machinery, faulty electrical equipment);\n\n\nII.ergonomic (e.g., improperly adjusted workstations and chairs, awkward movements, vibration);\n\n\nIII.chemical (e.g., exposure to carcinogens, mutagens, reprotoxic substances, solvents, carbon monoxide, or pesticides);\n\n\nIV.biological (e.g., exposure to blood and bodily fluids, fungi, bacteria, viruses, or insect bites);\n\n\nV.psychosocial (e.g., verbal abuse, harassment, bullying); \n\n\nVI.related to work-organisation (e.g., excessive workload demands, shift work, long hours, night work, workplace violence).",
        "Work-related incident": "Occurrence arising out of or in the course of work that could or does result in injury or ill health. Incidents might be due to, for example, electrical problems, explosion, fire, overflow, overturning, leakage, flow, breakage, bursting, splitting, loss of control, slipping, stumbling and falling, body movement without stress, body movement under/with stress, shock, fright, workplace violence or harassment (e.g., sexual harassment).\n\n\nAn incident that results in injury or ill health is often referred to as an ‘accident’. An incident that has the potential to result in injury or ill health but where none occurs is often referred to as a ‘close call', ‘near-miss’, or ‘near-hit’."
