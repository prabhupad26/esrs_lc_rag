The increase was mainly due to the \nTigo Guatemala acquisition and the subsequent issuance of debt. \nProfit before taxes was $238 million, reflecting the higher \noperating profit, partially offset by the net increase in financial \nexpenses mentioned above and other non-operating expenses \nof $78 million, mainly related to foreign exchange losses and \nthe revaluation charge of the put option in Panama.\nThe net tax charge was $222 million, leaving a net profit from \ncontinuing operations of $16 million for the year. \nAs a result, our net profit for the year, after discontinued \noperations stemming from the gain on disposal of our \noperations in Tanzania, was $129 million. The share of \nlosses of non-controlling interests was $48 million, reflecting \nour partners' share of net results in our subsidiaries in Colombia \nand Panama.\nThe net profit for the year attributable to Millicom owners was \n$177 million, an earnings per share of $1.27.\nShare Capital\nOn May 18, 2022, the Board of Directors of Millicom resolved on \na rights offering (the \"Rights Offering\") granting preferential \nsubscription rights to existing holders of shares and Swedish \nDepositary Receipts (\"SDRs\"). The Rights Offering resulted in the \nissuance of approximately 70.4 million new shares, which \nincreased the number of outstanding shares in Millicom. \nAt December 31, 2022, Millicom had approximately 172.1 \nmillion issued and paid-up common shares of par value $1.50 \neach, of which approximately 1.2 million were held by the \nCompany as treasury shares (2021: approximately 1.5 million).\nDuring the year, the Company did not acquire shares through its \nshare repurchase program. It issued approximately 378,000 \nshares to management and employees under the share-based \nplans, and issued approximately 41,000 shares to Directors as \npart of their annual remuneration.\nDistribution to Shareholders and Proposed Distributions\nOur shareholders approved the proposal from the Board not to \npay a dividend in 2022. No dividend was paid in 2021. \nFollowing the Group's decision to work towards the Rights Offering \nexplained above, during 2022, no shares were repurchased under \nthe share repurchase plans approved at the 2021 AGM (which was \nvalid until May 4, 2022) or the plan that was approved at the 2022 \nactivities undertaken by the Group, are set out in Section D, financial \nrisk management, of the consolidated financial statements.\nInternal controls and risk management on the preparation of \nthe consolidated financial statements are covered in the Our \nGovernance section starting on page 53.\nNon-Financial Information\nNon-financial information\u2014such as environmental, social and \ngovernance\u2014is integrated throughout this report.\nManagement and Employees \nIn recent years, the Group has developed many key functions \nand improved support to local operations, including in the areas \nof procurement, network development, marketing, IT, HR, \ncompliance and finance. \nAt December 31, 2022, the Group\u2019s headcount from continuing \noperations is approximately 20,000.\nFinancial targets1\nAs communicated on February 14, 2022, Millicom\u2019s financial \ntargets are:\n\u2022 Organic operating cash flow growth of around 10% per year \non average in 2022-2024\n\u2022 Cumulative Equity free cash flow of $800 million to $1.0 \nbillion in 2022-2024\n\u2022 Reduce leverage to 2.5x by 2025 and to 2.0x over the long term\nRisks and Uncertainty Factors\nThe Group operates in an industry and markets that are \ncharacterized by rapid change and are subject to macroeconomic, \ncompetitive and political uncertainty. These conditions create \nopportunities as well as a degree of risk. Many of the inherent \nunderlying risks in these markets\u2014including regulatory change \n(such as tariff controls and taxation), currency fluctuations and \nunderlying macroeconomic conditions such as inflation\u2014affect the \nlevel of disposable income, consumers\u2019 attitudes and demand for \nour products and services.\nSubsequent Events\nPotential acquisition\nOn January 25, 2023, Millicom confirmed that a potential \nacquisition of all outstanding shares in Millicom is being discussed \nwith Apollo Global Management and Claure Group.

These measures are referred to as \u201cnon-\nIFRS\u201d measures and include non-IFRS service revenue, non-IFRS \nEBITDA and non-IFRS Capex, among others defined below. \nAnnual growth rates for these non-IFRS measures are often \nexpressed in organic constant currency terms to exclude the \neffect of changes in foreign exchange rates and the adoption \nof new accounting standards, and are pro forma for material \nchanges in perimeter due to acquisitions and divestitures. The \nnon-IFRS financial measures are presented in this report, as \nMillicom\u2019s management believes they provide investors with \nadditional information for the analysis of Millicom\u2019s results of \noperations, particularly in evaluating performance from one \nperiod to another. Millicom\u2019s management uses non-IFRS \nfinancial measures to make operating decisions, as they \nfacilitate additional internal comparisons of Millicom\u2019s \nperformance to historical results and to competitors' results; \nand provides them to investors as a supplement to Millicom\u2019s \nreported results to provide additional insight into Millicom\u2019s \noperating performance.

In addition, these non-\nIFRS measures should not be considered in isolation as a \nsubstitute for, or as superior to, financial measures calculated in \naccordance with IFRS. Millicom\u2019s financial results calculated in \naccordance with IFRS and reconciliations to those financial \nstatements should be carefully evaluated.\nFollowing the changes in perimeter following the Guatemala \nacquisition and the Africa disposal, Millicom's management \nmodified the company's external reporting with the primary \nobjective of simplifying it. As a result, the Group has \ndiscontinued the use of the following non-IFRS measures: \nProportionate financial obligations, Proportionate leverage, \nProportionate leverage after leases, and all Underlying \nmeasures (as these mainly reflected the full consolidation of \nGuatemala). The definitions of EBITDA and Return on Invested \nCapital have been adjusted\ufffdto reflect this change. In addition, \nthe Group changed the definition of equity free cash flow to \ninclude spectrum paid and lease principal repayments in \nresponse to feedback from users of our financial statements \nwho prefer a more comprehensive view of our cash flow \ngeneration. As a result, we no longer refer to equity free cash \nflow 'after leases.'\nAlternative Performance Measure Description\nEBITDA margin represents EBITDA in relation to revenue.\nOrganic growth represents year-on-year growth excluding the \nimpact of changes in FX rates, perimeter and accounting. Changes \nin perimeter are the result of acquisitions and divestitures. Results \nfrom divested assets are immediately removed from both periods, \nwhereas the results from acquired assets are included in both \nperiods at the beginning (January 1) of the first full calendar \nyear of ownership.\nNet debt is debt and financial liabilities less cash and pledged \nand time deposits.\nNet financial obligations is net debt plus lease liabilities.\nLeverage is the ratio of net financial obligations over LTM (last \n12 months) EBITDA, pro forma for acquisitions made during the \nlast 12 months.\nLeverage after leases is the ratio of net debt over LTM (last 12 \nmonths) EBITDA after leases, pro forma for acquisitions and \ndisposals made during the last 12 months. \nCapex is balance sheet capital expenditure excluding spectrum \nand license costs and lease capitalizations. \nCash capex represents the cash spent in relation to capital \nexpenditure, excluding spectrum and licenses costs. \nOperating cash flow (OCF) is EBITDA less Capex. \nOperating free cash flow (OFCF) is EBITDA less cash capex, \nspectrum paid, working capital and other non-cash items and \ntaxes paid. \nEquity free cash flow (EFCF) is OFCF less finance charges paid \n(net), lease interest payments, lease principal payments and \nadvances for dividends to non-controlling interests, plus cash \nrepatriation from joint ventures and associates. \nOperating profit after tax displays the profit generated from the \noperations of the Company after statutory taxes. \nReturn on invested capital (ROIC) is used to assess the Group\u2019s \nefficiency at allocating the capital under its control and is \ndefined as operating profit after tax, divided by the average \ninvested capital during the period. \nAverage invested capital is the capital invested in the company \noperation throughout the year and is calculated with the \naverage of opening and closing balances of the total assets \nminus current liabilities (excluding debt, joint ventures, accrued \ninterests, deferred and current tax, cash, and investments and \nnon-controlling interests), less assets and liabilities held for sale.\nAverage revenue per user per month (ARPU) for our mobile \ncustomers is (x) the total mobile and mobile financial services \nrevenue (excluding revenue earned from tower rentals, call \ncenter, data and mobile virtual network operator, visitor \nroaming, national third parties roaming and mobile telephone \nequipment sales revenue) for the period, divided by (y) the", "blob_id": 3, "doc_ref": "121"}, {"text": "Service revenue is revenue related to the provision of ongoing \nservices such as monthly subscription fees for mobile and \nbroadband, airtime and data usage fees, interconnection fees, \nroaming fees, mobile finance service commissions and fees \nfrom other telecommunications services such as data services, \nshort message services, installation fees and other value-added \nservices, excluding telephone and equipment sales.  \nEBITDA is operating profit excluding impairment losses, \ndepreciation and amortization and gains/losses on fixed \nasset disposals. \nEBITDA after leases (EBITDAaL) represents EBITDA after lease \ninterest and principal repayments.", "blob_id": 4, "doc_ref": "121"}, {"text": "M i l l i c o m  2 0 2 2  A n n u a l  R e p o r t    1 2\nForward Looking Statements and Use of Non-IFRS Ter", "blob_id": 0, "doc_ref": "122"}, {"text": "Reconciliation from Reported Growth to Organic Growth for the Group", "blob_id": 1, "doc_ref": "122"}, {"text": "($ millions)\nRevenue\nService Revenue\nEBITDA\nOCF\nFY 2022\nFY 2021\nFY 2022\nFY 2021\nFY 2022\nFY 2021\nFY 2022\nFY 2021\nA- Current period\n5,624\n4,261\n5,171\n3,997\n2,228\n1,517\n1,255\n595\nB- Prior year period\n4,261\n3,805\n3,997\n3,604\n1,517\n1,362\n595\n614\nC- Reported growth (A/B)\n 32.0 %\n 12.0 %\n 29.4 %\n 10.9 %\n 46.8 %\n 11.4 %\n 111.0 %\n (3.1) %\nD- Perimeter\n 32.2 %\n 3.0 %\n 29.4 %\n 2.3 %\n 49.2 %\n 1.9 %\n 104.4 %\n 0.7 %\nE- FX and other\n (3.5) %\n 1.9 %\n (3.5) %\n 1.6 %\n (3.5) %\n 3.0 %\n (1.8) %\n (2.6) %\nF- Organic Growth (C-D-E)\n 3.3 %\n 7.1 %\n 3.5 %\n 7.0 %\n 1.2 %\n 6.5 %\n 8.4 %\n (1.2) %", "blob_id": 2, "doc_ref": "122"}, {"text": "Reconciliation from Reported Growth to Organic Growth for the Group's main markets", "blob_id": 3, "doc_ref": "122"}, {"text": "Service Revenue* ($ millions)\nFY 2022\nFY 2021\nOrganic\nFX & Others\nReported\nGuatemala\n1,373\n1,365\n 0.8 %\n (0.2) %\n 0.6 %\nColombia\n1,253\n1,319\n 6.6 %\n (11.7) %\n (5.0) %\nParaguay\n530\n526\n 4.2 %\n (3.1) %\n 0.9 %\nHonduras\n549\n548\n 2.0 %\n (1.9) %\n 0.1 %\nBolivia\n608\n612\n (0.6) %\n \u2014 %\n (0.6) %\nPanama\n624\n608\n 2.7 %\n \u2014 %\n 2.7 %\nEl Salvador\n429\n398\n 7.7 %\n \u2014 %\n 7.7 %\nNicaragua\n235\n225\n 6.7 %\n (1.9) %\n 4.6 %\nCosta Rica\n137\n139\n 2.8 %\n (4.1) %\n (1.4) %", "blob_id": 4, "doc_ref": "122"}, {"text": "*Accounting and perimeter changes do not applied and as such have been removed.

The aforementioned share prices and number of units granted have been amended \nas a result of the effect of the right offering (see note C.1. ). At the vesting date, the value of the MSU will be determined by the 30-\ntrading day average share price ending on June 30, 2022 for Tranche 2022, and the 30-trading day average share price ending on \nJune 30, 2023 for Tranche 2023. For each Tranche, the payment will be made in cash 12 months after those dates, provided the \nparticipant is still employed (subject to limited allowances for good leavers). For every participant, payment is capped at 150% of \ntheir Target MSU Award Value set up for each Tranche.
